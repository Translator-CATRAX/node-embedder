CHEBI:16240	hydrogen peroxide	Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a very pale blue liquid that appears colourless in a dilute solution. H2O2 is slightly more viscous than water and is a weak acid. H2O2 is unstable and slowly decomposes in the presence of light. It has strong oxidizing properties and is, therefore, a powerful bleaching agent that is mostly used for bleaching paper. H2O2 has also found use as a disinfectant and as an oxidizer. H2O2 in the form of carbamide peroxide is widely used for tooth whitening (bleaching), both in professionally- and in self-administered products. H2O2 is a well-documented component of living cells and is a normal metabolite of oxygen in the aerobic metabolism of cells and tissues. A total of 31 human cellular H2O2 generating enzymes has been identified so far (PMID: 25843657). H2O2 plays important roles in host defence and oxidative biosynthetic reactions. At high levels (>100 nM) H2O2 is toxic to most cells due to its ability to non-specifically oxidize proteins, membranes and DNA, leading to general cellular damage and dysfunction. However, at low levels (<10 nM), H2O2 functions as a signalling agent, particularly in higher organisms. In plants, H2O2 plays a role in signalling to cause cell shape changes such as stomatal closure and root growth. As a messenger molecule in vertebrates, H2O2 diffuses through cells and tissues to initiate cell shape changes, to drive vascular remodelling, and to activate cell proliferation and recruitment of immune cells. H2O2 also plays a role in redox sensing, signalling, and redox regulation (PMID: 28110218). This is normally done through molecular redox “switches” such as thiol-containing proteins. The production and decomposition of H2O2 are tightly regulated (PMID: 17434122). In humans, H2O2 can be generated in response to various stimuli, including cytokines and growth factors. H2O2 is degraded by several enzymes including catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD), both of which play important roles in keeping the amount of H2O2 in the body below toxic levels. H2O2 also appears to play a role in vitiligo. Vitiligo is a skin pigment disorder leading to patchy skin colour, especially among dark-skinned individuals. Patients with vitiligo have low catalase levels in their skin, leading to higher levels of H2O2. High levels of H2O2 damage the epidermal melanocytes, leading to a loss of pigment (PMID: 10393521). Accumulating evidence suggests that hydrogen peroxide H2O2 plays an important role in cancer development. Experimental data have shown that cancer cells produce high amounts of H2O2. An increase in the cellular levels of H2O2 has been linked to several key alterations in cancer, including DNA changes, cell proliferation, apoptosis resistance, metastasis, angiogenesis and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) activation (PMID: 17150302, 17335854, 16677071, 16607324, 16514169). H2O2 is found in most cells, tissues, and biofluids. H2O2 levels in the urine can be significantly increased with the consumption of coffee and other polyphenolic-containing beverages (wine, tea) (PMID: 12419961). In particular, roasted coffee has high levels of 1,2,4-benzenetriol which can, on its own, lead to the production of H2O2. Normal levels of urinary H2O2 in non-coffee drinkers or fasted subjects are between 0.5-3 uM/mM creatinine whereas, for those who drink coffee, the levels are between 3-10 uM/mM creatinine (PMID: 12419961). It is thought that H2O2 in urine could act as an antibacterial agent and that H2O2 is involved in the regulation of glomerular function (PMID: 10766414).

It has also an anticoagulant effect and is used in long-term low-doses to prevent heart attacks and cancer. It was isolated from meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria, formerly classified as Spiraea ulmaria) by German researchers in 1839. While their extract was somewhat effective, it also caused digestive problems such as irritated stomach and diarrhoea, and even death when consumed in high doses. In 1853, a French chemist named Charles Frederic Gerhardt neutralized salicylic acid by buffering it with sodium (sodium salicylate) and acetyl chloride, creating acetosalicylic anhydride. Gerhardt's product worked, but he had no desire to market it and abandoned his discovery. In 1897, researcher Arthur Eichengrun and Felix Hoffmann, a research assistant at Friedrich Bayer & Co. in Germany, derivatized one of the hydroxyl functional groups in salicylic acid with an acetyl group (forming the acetyl ester), which greatly reduced the negative effects. This was the first synthetic drug, not a copy of something that existed in nature, and the start of the pharmaceuticals industry. The name 'aspirin' is composed of a- (from the acetyl group) -spir- (from the plant genus Spiraea) and -in (a common ending for drugs at the time). It has also been stated that the name originated by another means. As referring to AcetylSalicylic and 'pir' in reference to one of the scientists who was able to isolate it in crystalline form, Raffaele Piria. Finally 'in' due to the same reasons as stated above. Salicylic acid (which is a naturally occurring substance found in many plants) can be acetylated using acetic anhydride, yielding aspirin and acetic acid as a byproduct. It is a common experiment performed in organic chemistry labs, and generally tends to produce low yields due to the relative difficulty of its extraction from an aqueous state. The trick to getting the reaction to work is to acidify with phosphoric acid and heat the reagents under reflux with a boiling water bath for between 40 minutes and an hour. Aspirin acts as an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase which results in the inhibition of the biosynthesis of prostaglandins. Aspirin also inhibits platelet aggregation and is used in the prevention of arterial and venous thrombosis. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p5).

It produces a dose-related inhibition of gastric acid and pepsin secretion, and enhances mucosal resistance to injury. It is an effective anti-ulcer agent and also has oxytocic properties. [PubChem]Misoprostol seems to inhibit gastric acid secretion by a direct action on the parietal cells through binding to the prostaglandin receptor. The activity of this receptor is mediated by G proteins which normally activate adenylate cyclase. The indirect inhibition of adenylate cyclase by Misoprostol may be dependent on guanosine-5&rsquo;-triphosphate (GTP). The significant cytoprotective actions of misoprostol are related to several mechanisms. These include: 1. Increased secretion of bicarbonate, 2. Considerable decrease in the volume and pepsin content of the gastric secretions, 3. It prevents harmful agents from disrupting the tight junctions between the epithelial cells which stops the subsequent back diffusion of H<sup>+</sup> ions into the gastric mucosa, 4. Increased thickness of mucus layer, 5. Enhanced mucosal blood flow as a result of direct vasodilatation, 6. Stabilization of tissue lysozymes/vascular endothelium, 7. Improvement of mucosal regeneration capacity, and 8. Replacement of prostaglandins that have been depleted as a result of various insults to the area.

CHEBI:135931	dexlansoprazole	UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T109; UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T121; Dexlansoprazole is a new generation proton pump inhibitor (PPI) used for the management of symptoms associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and erosive esophagitis. Dexlansoprazole is the R-enantiomer of [DB00448], which is composed of a racemic mixture of the R- and S-enantiomers. Compared to the older generation of PPIs (which includes [DB00213], [DB00338], and [DB00448]) [A178084], dexlansoprazole MR has a unique pharmacokinetic profile due to its delayed-release and dual-delivery release system. The active ingredient is released in two phases at different pH values and at different time points, resulting in two peak concentrations in the blood; 25% of the dose is released at pH 5.5 in the proximal duodenum, while the remaining 75% is released at pH 6.75 in the distal small intestine [A19567]. As a result, dexlansoprazole has a peak concentration within 1-2 hours after dosing and another within 4-5 hours [FDA Label]. Dexlansoprazole's unique pharmacokinetics addresses limitations of the older generation PPIs including short plasma half-life, break-through symptoms, and need for meal-associated dosing [A19568]. These characteristics make dexlansoprazole a good option for people who struggle with adherence and strict dosage timing before meals[A178087, A19566].     Dexlansoprazole exerts its stomach acid-suppressing effects in the same way as other drugs in the PPI family by inhibiting the final step in gastric acid production. Dexlansoprazole targets the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme, which is involved in the secretion of hydrochloric acid through the exchange of H+ ions from the cytoplasm for K+ ions. Normally functioning (H+, K+)-ATPase stimulates hydrochloric acid secretion into the gastric lumen thereby increasing stomach acidity and lowering pH. Once absorbed into circulation, dexlansoprazole covalently binds to the sulfhydryl groups of cysteines found on the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cells, which leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion. Despite dexlansoprazole's unique pharmacokinetic profile, efficacy in management of GERD symptoms is considered similar to other medications within the PPI class including [DB00338], [DB00736], [DB00448], [DB00213], and [DB01129].    Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as dexlansoprazole have been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients including iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life [A177571]. PPIs such as dexlansoprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes [A177577, A177580].     Dexlansoprazole doses should be slowly lowered, or tapered, before discontinuing as rapid discontinuation of PPIs such as dexlansoprazole may cause a rebound effect and a short term increase in hypersecretion [A177574].

CHEBI:518413	alverine	Alverine is a smooth muscle relaxant. Smooth muscle is a type of muscle that is not under voluntary control; it is the muscle present in places such as the gut and uterus. Alverine acts directly on the muscle in the gut, causing it to relax. This prevents the muscle spasms which occur in the gut in conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome and diverticular disease. It is used to relieve cramps or spasms of the stomach and intestines. It is also useful in treating irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and similar conditions. It can also be used to help relieve period pain. Alverine is formulated as the citrate salt (5982-87-6).

CHEBI:134765	isometheptene	Isometheptene is only found in individuals that have used or taken this drug. It is a sympathomimetic drug which causes vasoconstriction. It is used for treating migraines and tension headaches.Isometheptene's vasoconstricting properties arise through activation of the sympathetic nervous system via epinephrine and norepinephrine (or their molecular analogues as is the case with this drug). These compounds elicites smooth muscle activation leading to vasoconstriction. These compounds interact with cell surface adrenergic receptors. Such stimuli result in a signal transduction cascade that leads to increased intracellular calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum through IP3 mediated calcium release, as well as enhanced calcium entry across the sarcolemma through calcium channels. The rise in intracellular calcium complexes with calmodulin, which in turn activates myosin light chain kinase. This enzyme is responsible for phosphorylating the light chain of myosin to stimulate cross bridge cycling.Once elevated, the intracellular calcium concentration is returned to its basal level through a variety of protein pumps and calcium exchangers located on the plasma membrane and sarcoplasmic reticulum. This reduction in calcium removes the stimulus necessary for contraction allowing for a return to baseline. The drug can also cause vesicular displacement of noradrenaline from the neuron into the synapse with a similar effect as tyramine.

It is part of the secondary metabolites of plants. Scopolamine is used criminally as a date rape drug and as an aid to robbery, the most common act being the clandestine drugging of a victim's drink. It is preferred because it induces retrograde amnesia, or an inability to recall events prior to its administration. Victims of this crime are often admitted to a hospital in police custody, under the assumption that the patient is experiencing a psychotic episode. A telltale sign is a fever accompanied by a lack of sweat. An alkaloid from Solanaceae, especially Datura metel L. and Scopola carniolica. Scopolamine and its quaternary derivatives act as antimuscarinics like atropine, but may have more central nervous system effects. Among the many uses are as an anesthetic premedication, in urinary incontinence, in motion sickness, as an antispasmodic, and as a mydriatic and cycloplegic.

CHEBI:6899	metoclopramide hydrochloride	Metoclopramide is only found in individuals that have used or taken this drug. It is a dopamine D2 antagonist that is used as an antiemetic. [PubChem]Metoclopramide inhibits gastric smooth muscle relaxation produced by dopamine, therefore increasing cholinergic response of the gastrointestinal smooth muscle. It accelerates intestinal transit and gastric emptying by preventing relaxation of gastric body and increasing the phasic activity of antrum. Simultaneously, this action is accompanied by relaxation of the upper small intestine, resulting in an improved coordination between the body and antrum of the stomach and the upper small intestine. Metoclopramide also decreases reflux into the esophagus by increasing the resting pressure of the lower esophageal sphincter and improves acid clearance from the esophagus by increasing amplitude of esophageal peristaltic contractions. Metoclopramide's dopamine antagonist action raises the threshold of activity in the chemoreceptor trigger zone and decreases the input from afferent visceral nerves. Studies have also shown that high doses of metoclopramide can antagonize 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors in the peripheral nervous system in animals.

[PubChem]Domperidone acts as a gastrointestinal emptying (delayed) adjunct and peristaltic stimulant. The gastroprokinetic properties of domperidone are related to its peripheral dopamine receptor blocking properties. Domperidone facilitates gastric emptying and decreases small bowel transit time by increasing esophageal and gastric peristalsis and by lowering esophageal sphincter pressure. Antiemetic: The antiemetic properties of domperidone are related to its dopamine receptor blocking activity at both the chemoreceptor trigger zone and at the gastric level. It has strong affinities for the D2 and D3 dopamine receptors, which are found in the chemoreceptor trigger zone, located just outside the blood brain barrier, which - among others - regulates nausea and vomiting

CHEBI:134813	chlorobutanol	UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T109; UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T121; Chlorobutanol, or chlorbutol, is an alcohol-based preservative with no surfactant activity [A32746]. It also elicits sedative-hypnotic and weak local anesthetic actions in addition to antibacterial and antifungal properties. Similar in nature to chloral hydrate, it is formed by the simple nucleophilic addition of chloroform and acetone.     As a long-term stabilizer of multi-ingredient preparations, chlorobutanol is normally used at a concentration of 0.5%. At this concentration, it also conserves its antimicrobial activity.     Due to the long terminal half-life of 37 days, the use of chlorobutanol as a sedative is limited because of the considerable accumulation which will occur following multiple dosing [A32743].

CHEBI:66964	Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol	"Tetrahydrocannabinol, abbreviated THC, is a cannabinoid identified in cannabis and is its principal psychoactive constituent. First isolated in 1964, in its pure form, it is a glassy solid when cold, and becomes viscous and sticky if warmed. Synthetically prepared THC, officially referred to by its INN, dronabinol, is available by prescription in the U.S. and Canada under the brand name Marinol. The mechanism of action of THC is not completely understood. It is thought that cannabinoid receptors in neural tissues may mediate the effects of cannabinoids. Animal studies suggest that Marinol's antiemetic effects may be due to inhibition of the vomiting control mechanism in the medulla oblongata. A literature review on the subject concluded that ""Cannabis use appears to be neither a sufficient nor a necessary cause for psychosis. It is a component cause, part of a complex constellation of factors leading to psychosis."" Likewise, a French review from 2009 came to a conclusion that cannabis use, particularly that before age 15, was a factor in the development of schizophrenic disorders. An aromatic terpenoid, THC has a very low solubility in water, but good solubility in most organic solvents, specifically lipids and alcohols. The presence of these specialized cannabinoid receptors in the brain led researchers to the discovery of endocannabinoids, such as anandamide and 2-arachidonoyl glyceride (2-AG). THC targets receptors in a manner far less selective than endocannabinoid molecules released during retrograde signalling, as the drug has a relatively low cannabinoid receptor efficacy and affinity. In populations of low cannabinoid receptor density, THC may act to antagonize endogenous agonists that possess greater receptor efficacy. THC is a lipophilic molecule and may bind non-specifically to a variety of receptors in the brain and body, such as adipose tissue. Dronabinol is only found in individuals that have used or taken this drug. It is extracted from the resin of Cannabis sativa (marijuana, hashish). The isomer delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol is considered the most active form, producing the characteristic mood and perceptual changes associated with this compound. In the United States, Marinol has been rescheduled from Schedule II to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act in 1999, reflecting a finding that THC had a potential for abuse less than that of cocaine and heroin. As a Schedule III drug, it is available by prescription and is considered to be non-narcotic and to have a low risk of physical or mental dependence. Marinol has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the treatment of anorexia in AIDS patients, as well as for refractory nausea and vomiting of patients undergoing chemotherapy, which has raised much controversy as to why natural THC is still a Schedule I drug. Efforts to get cannabis rescheduled as analogous to Marinol have not succeeded thus far. In April 2005, Canadian authorities approved the marketing of Sativex, a mouth spray for multiple sclerosis patients, who can use it to alleviate neuropathic pain and spasticity. Sativex contains tetrahydrocannabinol together with cannabidiol and is a preparation of whole cannabis rather than individual cannabinoids. It is marketed in Canada by GW Pharmaceuticals, being the first cannabis-based prescription drug in the world (in modern times). In addition, Sativex received European regulatory approval in 2010. An analog of dronabinol, nabilone, is available commercially in Canada under the trade name Cesamet, manufactured by Valeant Pharmaceuticals. Cesamet has also received FDA approval and began marketing in the U.S. in 2006. It is a Schedule II drug."
UNII:2N4O9L084N	NABILONE	UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T109; UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T121; Nabilone (marketed as Cesamet) is a synthetic form of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ⁹-THC), the primary psychoactive component of cannabis (marijuana). Although structurally distinct from THC, nabilone mimics THC's structure and pharmacological activity through weak partial agonist activity at Cannabinoid-1 (CB1R) and Cannabinoid-2 (CB2R) receptors, however it is considered to be twice as active as Δ⁹-THC. Nabilone is approved by the FDA for the treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conventional antiemetic treatments [FDA Label].    Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are the two most abundant cannabinoids found naturally in the resin of the marijuana plant, both of which are pharmacologically active due to their interaction with cannabinoid receptors that are found throughout the body [A32830]. While both CBD and THC are used for medicinal purposes, they have different receptor activity, function, and physiological effects. If not provided in their activated form (such as through synthetic forms like Nabilone or [DB00470]), THC and CBD are obtained through conversion from their precursors, tetrahydrocannabinolic acid-A (THCA-A) and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), through decarboxylation reactions. This can be achieved through heating, smoking, vaporization, or baking of dried unfertilized female cannabis flowers.    From a pharmacological perspective, Cannabis' diverse receptor profile explains its potential application for such a wide variety of medical conditions. Cannabis contains more than 400 different chemical compounds, of which 61 are considered cannabinoids, a class of compounds that act upon endogenous cannabinoid receptors of the body [A32584]. The endocannabinoid system is widely distributed throughout the central and peripheral nervous system (via the Cannabinoid Receptors CB1 and CB2) and plays a role in many physiological processes such as inflammation, cardiovascular function, learning, pain, memory, stress and emotional regulation, and the sleep/wake cycle among many others [A32824]. CB1 receptors are found in both the central and peripheral nervous system, and are most abundant in the hippocampus and amygdala, which are the areas of the brain responsible for short-term memory storage and emotional regulation. CB2 receptors are mainly located in the peripheral nervous system and can be found on lymphoid tissue where they are involved in regulation of immune function [A32676].    In Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom and Mexico, nabilone is marketed as Cesamet. It was approved in 1985 by the United States FDA for treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting that has not responded to conventional antiemetics. Though it was approved by the FDA in 1985, the drug only began marketing in the United States in 2006. It is also approved for use in treatment of anorexia and weight loss in patients with AIDS.    Nabilone is a racemate consisting of the (S,S) and the (R,R) isomers.

The distinction between different bile acids is minute, depends only on presence or absence of hydroxyl groups on positions 3, 7, and 12. Bile acids are physiological detergents that facilitate excretion, absorption, and transport of fats and sterols in the intestine and liver. Bile acids are also steroidal amphipathic molecules derived from the catabolism of cholesterol. They modulate bile flow and lipid secretion, are essential for the absorption of dietary fats and vitamins, and have been implicated in the regulation of all the key enzymes involved in cholesterol homeostasis. Bile acids recirculate through the liver, bile ducts, small intestine and portal vein to form an enterohepatic circuit. They exist as anions at physiological pH and, consequently, require a carrier for transport across the membranes of the enterohepatic tissues. The unique detergent properties of bile acids are essential for the digestion and intestinal absorption of hydrophobic nutrients. Bile acids have potent toxic properties (e.g., membrane disruption) and there are a plethora of mechanisms to limit their accumulation in blood and tissues.

CHEBI:16359	cholic acid	Cholic acid is a major primary bile acid produced in the liver and is usually conjugated with glycine or taurine. It facilitates fat absorption and cholesterol excretion. Bile acids are steroid acids found predominantly in the bile of mammals. The distinction between different bile acids is minute, and depends only on the presence or absence of hydroxyl groups on positions 3, 7, and 12.

When present in sufficiently high levels, cholic acid can act as a hepatotoxin and a metabotoxin. A hepatotoxin causes damage to the liver or liver cells. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Among the primary bile acids, cholic acid is considered to be the least hepatotoxic while deoxycholic acid is the most hepatoxic (PMID: 1641875). The liver toxicity of bile acids appears to be due to their ability to peroxidate lipids and to lyse liver cells. Chronically high levels of cholic acid are associated with familial hypercholanemia. In hypercholanemia, bile acids, including cholic acid, are elevated in the blood. This disease causes liver damage, extensive itching, poor fat absorption, and can lead to rickets due to lack of calcium in bones. The deficiency of normal bile acids in the intestines results in a deficiency of vitamin K, which also adversely affects clotting of the blood. The bile acid ursodiol (ursodeoxycholic acid) can improve symptoms associated with familial hypercholanemia.

N-methylnicotinamide is a metabolite of niacin (or nicotinamide) and is commonly found in human urine. However low levels of urinary excretion of N-methylnicotinamide indicates niacin deficiency. (PMID:16207585). In patients with liver cirrhosis nicotinamide methylation is increased leading to a rise in urinary N-methylnicotinamide. The hyperfunction of this methylating pathway might play a protective role against the toxic effect of intracellular accumulation of nicotinamide deriving from the catabolic state of cirrhosis. N-methylnicotinamide is known to inhibit choline transport and reduce choline clearance out of the brain. N-methylnicotinamide has been found to be a microbial metabolite.

(From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p887); A disaccharide (sugar) synthesized from fructose and galactose, Lactulose is used to treat constipation and some liver diseases. Nondigestible in mammals, lactulose passes unabsorbed down to the large intestine where resident bacteria consume it and produce lactic, acetic, and formic acids, which draw fluid into the bowel to soften the stool (laxative effect). Acidification of the colon contents attracts ammonia from the bloodstream, assisting stool excretion; helpful in liver failure when ammonia cannot be detoxified.

Sodium sulfate anhydrous disassociates in water to provide sodium ions and sulfate ions. Sodium ion is the principal cation of the extracellular fluid and plays a large part in the therapy of fluid and electrolyte disturbances. Sodium sulfate anhydrous is an electrolyte replenisher and is used in isosmotic solutions so that administration does not disturb normal electrolyte balance and does not lead to absorption or excretion of water and ions.
CHEBI:25879	pentaerythritol tetranitrate	UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T109; UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T121; Pentaerythritol tetranitrate is the nitrate ester of pentaerythritol that possesses explosive properties. When mixed with a plasticizer, this chemical forms a plastic explosive. It is recognized by the FDA to be a coronary vasodilator in the treatment of heart conditions such as angina [L2395].    It is a pentaerythritol nitrate in which all four hydroxy groups of pentaerythritol have been converted to the corresponding nitrate ester. It is a vasodilator with properties that are quite similar to those of glyceryl trinitrate, however, with a more prolonged duration of action. It is also one of the most powerful high explosives known and is a component of the plastic explosive known as Semtex [L2393].    PETN has the chemical formula C5H8N4O12. It is formed by reacting pentaerythritol (C5H12O4), an alcohol commonly used in paints and varnishes, with nitric acid (HNO2). The reacting solution is chilled to precipitate the PETN.  It is then filtered out, washed, dried, and recrystallized to produce a colorless crystalline material that is stored and shipped as a mixture with water and alcohol [L2394].    Interestingly, this drug was studied for potential benefits in chronic ischemic heart failure patients.  PETN targeting reactive oxygen species generation halted the changes of mitochondrial antioxidant enzymes and progressive fibrotic remodeling, leading to amelioration of cardiac functional performance in rats with ischemic heart failure [A32649].
CHEBI:30742	ethylene glycol	Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a polyether compound with many applications from industrial manufacturing to medicine. PEG is also known as polyethylene oxide (PEO) or polyoxyethylene (POE), depending on its molecular weight. PEG, PEO, or POE refers to an oligomer or polymer of ethylene oxide. Polyethylene glycol is produced by the interaction of ethylene oxide with water, ethylene glycol, or ethylene glycol oligomers. PEG is the basis of a number of laxatives (e.g. macrogol-containing products such as Movicol and polyethylene glycol 3350, or SoftLax, MiraLAX, or GlycoLax). Whole bowel irrigation with polyethylene glycol and added electrolytes is used for bowel preparation before surgery or colonoscopy. PEG is used as an excipient in many pharmaceutical products. Lower-molecular-weight variants are used as solvents in oral liquids and soft capsules, whereas solid variants are used as ointment bases, tablet binders, film coatings, and lubricants (Wikipedia). It has been shown that polyethylene glycol can improve healing of spinal injuries in dogs. Earlier findings that polyethylene glycol can aid in nerve repair came from the University of Texas (Krause and Bittner). Polyethylene glycol is commonly used to fuse B-cells with myeloma cells in monoclonal antibody production. PEG has recently been proven to give better results in constipation patients than tegaserod. Since PEG is a flexible, water-soluble polymer, it can be used to create very high osmotic pressures (tens of atmospheres). It also is unlikely to have specific interactions with biological chemicals. These properties make PEG one of the most useful molecules for applying osmotic pressure in biochemistry experiments, particularly when using the osmotic stress technique. Polyethylene glycol has been shown to exhibit excitant, anesthetic, radical scavenger, anti-microbial, and laxative functions (PMID: 10726226, 9485637, 11179847, 19089178, 20011352).
CHEBI:16899	D-mannitol	Mannitol is a diuretic and renal diagnostic aid related to sorbitol. It has little significant energy value as it is largely eliminated from the body before any metabolism can take place. It can be used to treat oliguria associated with kidney failure or other manifestations of inadequate renal function and has been used for determination of glomerular filtration rate. Mannitol is also commonly used as a research tool in cell biological studies, usually to control osmolarity. Chemically, mannitol is an alcohol and a sugar, or a polyol; it is similar to xylitol or sorbitol. However, mannitol has a tendency to lose a hydrogen ion in aqueous solutions, which causes the solution to become acidic. For this, it is not uncommon to add a substance to adjust its pH, such as sodium bicarbonate. Mannitol is a non-permeating molecule i.e. it cannot cross biological membranes. Mannitol or hexan-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexol (C6H8(OH)6) is an osmotic diuretic agent and a weak renal vasodilator. It is a sorbitol isomer.
CHEBI:34683	disodium hydrogenphosphate	It is used in foods as a sequestrant, emulsifier, buffering agent, absorbent, pH control agent, protein modifier, source of alkalinity, stabiliser and nutrient supplement. Disodium hydrogen phosphate (Na2HPO4) is a sodium salt of phosphoric acid. It is a white powder that is highly hygroscopic and water soluble. It is therefore used commercially as an anti-caking additive in powdered products. It is also known as disodium hydrogen orthophosphate, sodium hydrogen phosphate or sodium phosphate dibasic. It is commercially available in both the hydrated and anhydrous forms.
CHEBI:17924	D-glucitol	A polyhydric alcohol with about half the sweetness of sucrose. Sorbitol occurs naturally and is also produced synthetically from glucose.

It is also used in many manufacturing processes, as a pharmaceutical aid, and in several research applications.; A sugar alcohol found in fruits and plants with diuretic, laxative and cathartic property. Unabsorbed sorbitol retains water in the large intestine through osmotic pressure thereby stimulating peristalsis of the intestine and exerting its diuretic, laxative and cathartic effect. In addition, sorbitol has one-third fewer calories and 60 % the sweetening activity of sucrose and is used as a sugar replacement in diabetes.; UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T109; UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T121

CHEBI:17754	glycerol	Glycerol or glycerin is a colourless, odourless, viscous liquid that is sweet-tasting and mostly non-toxic. It is widely used in the food industry as a sweetener and humectant and in pharmaceutical formulations. Glycerol is an important component of triglycerides (i.e. fats and oils) and of phospholipids. Glycerol is a three-carbon substance that forms the backbone of fatty acids in fats. When the body uses stored fat as a source of energy, glycerol and fatty acids are released into the bloodstream. The glycerol component can be converted into glucose by the liver and provides energy for cellular metabolism. Normally, glycerol shows very little acute toxicity and very high oral doses or acute exposures can be tolerated. On the other hand, chronically high levels of glycerol in the blood are associated with glycerol kinase deficiency (GKD). GKD causes the condition known as hyperglycerolemia, an accumulation of glycerol in the blood and urine. There are three clinically distinct forms of GKD: infantile, juvenile, and adult. The infantile form is the most severe and is associated with vomiting, lethargy, severe developmental delay, and adrenal insufficiency. The mechanisms of glycerol toxicity in infants are not known, but it appears to shift metabolism towards chronic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7.35. In infants with acidosis, the initial symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, loss of appetite, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and lack of energy (lethargy). These can progress to heart, liver, and kidney abnormalities, seizures, coma, and possibly death. These are also the characteristic symptoms of untreated GKD. Many affected children with organic acidemias experience intellectual disability or delayed development. Patients with the adult form of GKD generally have no symptoms and are often detected fortuitously.

CHEBI:7459	naloxone	"UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T109; Naloxone is an opioid antagonist medication used to block or reverse the effects of opioid drugs, particularly within the setting of drug overdoses which are rapidly becoming a leading cause of death worldwide.[A234594] More specifically, naloxone has a high affinity for μ-opioid receptors, where it acts as an inverse agonist, causing the rapid removal of any other drugs bound to these receptors.[A234594] When taken in large quantities, opioid medications such as [morphine], [hydromorphone], [methadone], [heroin], or [fentanyl] are capable of causing life-threatening symptoms such as respiratory depression, reduced heart rate, slurred speech, drowsiness, and constricted pupils.[A234594,L33724] If untreated, this can progress to vomiting, absent pulse and breathing, loss of consciousness, and even death.[L33724] Naloxone is indicated for the rapid reversal of these symptoms of central nervous system depression in opioid overdose.[A234589] It's important to note that naloxone only works on opioid receptors within the body, and is therefore not capable of reversing the effects of non-opioid medications such as stimulants like [methamphetamine] or [cocaine], or benzodiazepines like [lorazepam] or [diazepam].     Also known as the brand name product Narcan, naloxone is currently available by intramuscular (IM) or subcutaneous (SubQ) injection, nasal spray, or intravenous (IV) infusion.[L33729,L33739] Naloxone IM injections are commonly available in the form of ""kits"", which is ideal for making overdose treatment accessible and readily available for administration by minimally trained individuals within the community.[L33734] Kits commonly include the supplies necessary to treat an overdose in a non-medical setting such as alcohol swabs, syringes, a rescue breathing mask, and instructions for use. Frequently also carried by medical and emergency personnel and at events known to be associated with heavy drug use like music festivals, naloxone kits are considered a key component of harm reduction strategies.    When injected intramuscularly (IM), naloxone acts within three to five minutes. Administration of naloxone is associated with very few side effects. Notably, if injected into a person not currently using opioid medications, there would be no noticeable effects at all. However, for individuals using opioid medications or experiencing an overdose, IM injection of naloxone rapidly reverses opioid effects and can cause the injected individual to immediately experience withdrawal symptoms.[A234589] Common symptoms of opioid withdrawal include nausea, vomiting, sweating, runny nose, aches, and diarrhea.[A234589] Although certainly physically uncomfortable, opioid withdrawal symptoms are not life-threatening; administration of naloxone is therefore appropriate for any person appearing to have any symptoms of an opioid overdose. Due to its short duration of action, persons injected with naloxone should be monitored for responsiveness and potentially injected a second time or taken to the hospital.[A234589]    Naloxone is also available within the combination product Suboxone with the opioid medication [buprenorphine].[L33714,L33719] Suboxone is used for the maintenance treatment of opioid dependence and addiction.[L33714,L33719] When taken orally, naloxone has no pharmacological effect and does not reduce the effectiveness of the opioid effect of buprenorphine.[L33714,L33719] The primary purpose of including naloxone within Suboxone is to act as a deterrent to injection, as injected naloxone would rapidly reverse the effects of buprenorphine.[L33714,L33719]    Naloxone was granted FDA approval on 13 April 1971.[L33709]"

Upon oral administration, linaclotide binds to and activates GC-C receptors located on the luminal surface of the intestinal epithelium. This increases the concentration of intracellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which is derived from guanosine triphosphate (GTP). cGMP activates the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and stimulates the secretion of chloride and bicarbonate into the intestinal lumen. This promotes sodium excretion into the lumen and results in increased intestinal fluid secretion. This ultimately accelerates GI transit of intestinal contents, improves bowel movement and relieves constipation. Increased extracellular cGMP levels may also exert an antinociceptive effect, through an as of yet not fully elucidated mechanism, that may involve modulation of nociceptors found on colonic afferent pain fibers.

UNII:7IK8Z952OK	PLECANATIDE	An agonist of intestinal guanylate cyclase type C (GC-C) which is almost structurally identical to human uroguanylin, with laxative and anti-nociceptive activities. Upon oral administration, plecanatide binds to and activates GC-C receptors located on endothelial cells on the luminal surface of the intestinal epithelium. This increases the concentration of intracellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). cGMP activates the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) ion channel and stimulates the secretion of chloride and bicarbonate into the intestinal lumen. This also promotes sodium excretion into the lumen and osmosis. The increased intestinal fluid secretion accelerates gastrointestinal transit of intestinal contents, improves bowel movement, softens stool, and relieves constipation. In addition, plecanatide exerts its anti-nociceptive effects by increasing the concentration of extracellular cGMP which inhibits the activity of pain-sensitive nerves, decreases muscle contractions and may relieve intestinal pain.; UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T109; UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T121

CHEBI:7934	paromomycin	Paromomycin is only found in individuals that have used or taken this drug. It is an oligosaccharide antibiotic produced by various streptomyces. [PubChem]Paromomycin inhibits protein synthesis by binding to 16S ribosomal RNA. Bacterial proteins are synthesized by ribosomal RNA complexes which are composed of 2 subunits, a large subunit (50s) and small (30s) subunit, which forms a 70s ribosomal subunit. tRNA binds to the top of this ribosomal structure. Paramomycin binds to the A site, which causes defective polypeptide chains to be produced. Continuous production of defective proteins eventually leads to bacterial death.

[PubChem]Aminoglycosides like kanamycin ""irreversibly"" bind to specific 30S-subunit proteins and 16S rRNA. Specifically Kanamycin binds to four nucleotides of 16S rRNA and a single amino acid of protein S12. This interferes with decoding site in the vicinity of nucleotide 1400 in 16S rRNA of 30S subunit. This region interacts with the wobble base in the anticodon of tRNA. This leads to interference with the initiation complex, misreading of mRNA so incorrect amino acids are inserted into the polypeptide leading to nonfunctional or toxic peptides and the breakup of polysomes into nonfunctional monosomes."

CHEBI:68590	fidaxomicin	UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T109; UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T195; Fidaxomicin is a novel macrolide antibiotic used in the treatment of diarrhea caused by _Clostridioides_ (formerly _Clostridium_) _difficile_ in adult and pediatric patients over the age of 6 months.[L11575] Fidaxomicin is a naturally-occurring 18-member macrocycle derived from fermentation.[A190501] Because fidaxomicin contains an 18-membered lactone ring in its structure, it is referred to as a macrocyclic lactone antibiotic drug.[A190492] The antibacterial activity of fidaxomicin is distinct from macrolides and rifamycins, as the bactericidal activity is time-dependent, and not concentration-dependent.[A190492] Fidaxomicin was the first macrocyclic lactone antibiotic with activity against _C. difficile_,[A190486] and it displays a narrow spectrum of activity against gram-positive anaerobes.[A7445] It mediates its potent bactericidal action on the bacteria by inhibiting the bacterial RNA synthase, thereby disrupting bacterial transcription.[A190486] The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC<sub>90</sub>) for fidaxomicin is four times less than that of [vancomycin], which was the primary drug of choice for _C. difficile_ infection before the approval of fidaxomicin.[A190492] Unlike vancomycin, however, fidaxomicin has a negligible effect on normal colonic microflora.[A190516]    The FDA initially approved fidaxomicin in May 2011 for the treatment of _C. difficile_-associated diarrhea in adult patients over the age of 18.[A190492] Later that year in December, the drug was also approved by the European Medicine Agency.[A190492] In June 2012, fidaxomicin was also granted approval by Health Canada.[A190486] The approved indication of fidaxomicin was expanded by the FDA in January 2020 to include pediatric patients over the age of 6 months in the treatment population.[L11575]
CHEBI:26580	rifamycins	UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T109; UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T195; Rifamycin is the prime member of the rifamycin family which are represented by drugs that are a product of fermentation from the gram-positive bacterium _Amycolatopsis mediterranei_, also known as _Streptomyces mediterranei_. The parent compound of rifamycin was rifamycin B which was originally obtained as a main product in the presence of diethylbarburitic acid. Some small modifications where performed in this inactive compound and with the creation of rifamycin SV there was the first antibiotic used intravenously for the treatment of tuberculosis.[A39990]    Rifamycin has had several direct derivative products such as rifamycin SV, rifaximin, rifampin and rifamycin CV. All of the derivatives have slight different physicochemical properties when compared to the parent structure.[A39986]    Rifamycin was further developed by Cosmo Technologies Ltd and approved in November 16, 2018 by the FDA as a prescription drug after being granted the designation of Qualified Infectious Disease Product which allowed it to have a status a priority review.[L4800] This drug was also sent for review to the EMA in 2015 by Dr. Falk Pharma Gmbh and it was granted a waiver for the tested conditions.[L4801]

CHEBI:185135	1-(1,2-Diphosphanylethyl)pyrrolidin-2-one	Polyvidone is used as a diluent in colour additive mixtures for marking food; in coatings on fresh citrus fruits; as a clarifying agent for beer, wine and vinegar; as a tableting adjuvant. A cross-linked form of PVP is also used as a disintegrant (see also excipients) in pharmaceutical tablets. It is also known as cross-linked polyvinyl pyrrolidone, Polyvinyl Polypyrrolidone (PVPP), crospovidone, crospolividone. Basically, PVPP is a highly cross-linked version of PVP, which makes it insoluble in water but it still absorbs water and swells very rapidly and generate a swelling force. That is why it can be used a disintegrant in tablets. It is also used to bind impurities to remove them from solutions.It is also used as a fining to extract impurities (via agglomeration followed by filtration). Using the same principle it is used to remove polyphenols in beer production and thus clear beers with stable foam are produced. PVPP can be used as well as a drug taken as a tablet or suspension and it absorbs compounds (so called Endotoxins) causing diarrhoea. (Cf. bone char, charcoal.); As a food additive, PVP is a stabilizer and has E number E1201. PVPP is E1202. It is also used in the wine industry as a fining agent for white wine. Other references state that as polyvinyl pyrrolidone and its derivatives are fully from mineral synthetic origin. Therefore, its use in the production should not be a problem for vegans. PVP is soluble in water and other polar solvents. In water it has the useful property of Newtonian viscosity. When dry it is a light flaky powder, which readily absorbs up to 40% of its weight in atmospheric water. In solution, it has excellent wetting properties and readily forms films. This makes it good as a coating or an additive to coatings. PVP was first synthesized by Prof. Walter Reppe and a patent was filed in 1939 for one of the most interesting derivatives of acetylene chemistry. PVP was initially used as a blood plasma substitute and later in a wide variety of applications in medicine, pharmacy, cosmetics and industrial production. Polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP, crospovidone) is a highly cross-linked modification of PVP. Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) is a water-soluble polymer made from the monomer N-vinylpyrrolidone:.

Its unesterified metabolite difenoxin has similar properties and is used similarly. It has little or no analgesic activity. This medication is classified as a Schedule V under the Controlled Substances Act by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the DEA in the United States when used in preparations. When diphenoxylate is used alone, it is classified as a Schedule II.
CHEBI:7003	morphine sulfate	Morphine is the principal alkaloid in opium and the prototype opiate analgesic and narcotic. In 2017, morphine was the 155th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than four million prescriptions. Morphine is used primarily to treat both acute and chronic severe pain. Its duration of analgesia is about three to seven hours. A large overdose of morphine can cause asphyxia and death by respiratory depression if the person does not receive medical attention immediately. Morphine is naturally produced by several plants (such as the opium poppy) and animals (PMID: 22578954). Morphine was first isolated between 1803 and 1805 by Friedrich Sertürner. Sertürner originally named the substance morphium after the Greek god of dreams, Morpheus, as it has a tendency to cause sleep. The primary source of morphine is isolation from poppy straw of the opium poppy. Morphine is also endogenously produced by humans. In the mid 2000s it was found morphine can be synthesized by white blood cells (PMID 22578954). CYP2D6, a cytochrome P450 isoenzyme, catalyzes the biosynthesis of morphine from codeine and dopamine from tyramine. The morphine biosynthetic pathway in humans occurs as follows: L-tyrosine -> para-tyramine or L-DOPA -> dopamine -> (S)-norlaudanosoline -> (S)-reticuline -> 1,2-dehydroretinulinium -> (R)-reticuline -> salutaridine -> salutaridinol -> thebaine -> neopinone -> codeinone -> codeine -> morphine.  (S)-Norlaudanosoline (also known as tetrahydropapaveroline) which is an important intermediate in the WBC biosynthesis of morphine can also be synthesized from 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (DOPAL), a metabolite of L-DOPA and dopamine. Morphine has widespread effects in the central nervous system and on smooth muscle (PMID: 4582903). The precise mechanism of the analgesic action of morphine is not fully known. However, specific CNS opiate receptors have been identified and likely play a role in the induction of analgesic effects. Morphine first acts on the mu-opioid receptors. The mechanism of respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to increases in carbon dioxide tension and electrical stimulation. It has been shown that morphine binds to and inhibits GABA inhibitory interneurons. These interneurons normally inhibit the descending pain inhibition pathway. So, without the inhibitory signals, pain modulation can proceed downstream. When the dose of morphine is reduced after long-term use, opioid withdrawal symptoms such as drowsiness, vomiting, and constipation may also occur (PMID: 23244430). Morphine is only found in easily detectable quantities in individuals that have used or taken this drug.
CHEBI:6532	loperamide	"The hydrochloride salt form of loperamide, a synthetic, piperidine derivative and opioid agonist with antidiarrheal activity. Loperamide acts on the mu-receptors in the intestinal mucosa.

CHEBI:4534	difenoxin	UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T109; UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T121; Difenoxin is a 4-phenylpiperidine which is closely related to the opioid analgesic meperidine. Difenoxin alone is a USA Schedule I controlled drug, as it may be habit forming. However, it is listed as a Schedule IV controlled drug if combined with atropine, which is added to decrease deliberate misuse. Motofen(R) is a brand mixture which combines atropine sulfate and difenoxin hydrochloride. It is approved by the FDA to treat acute and chronic diarrhea.      Difenoxin is an active metabolite of the anti-diarrheal drug, diphenoxylate, which is also used in combination with atropine in the brand mixture Lomotil(R). It works mostly in the periphery and activates opioid receptors in the intestine rather than the central nervous system (CNS). [3] Difenoxin is also closely related to loperamide, but unlike loperamide it is still capable of crossing the blood brain barrier to produce weak sedative and analgesic effects. However, the antidiarrheal potency of difenoxin is much greater than its CNS effects, which makes it an attractive alternative to other opioids.

CHEBI:85980	eluxadoline	UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T116; UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T121; Eluxadoline is a mixed mu-opioid receptor agonist, kappa-opioid receptor agonist, and a-delta opioid receptor antagonist indicated for use in diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D). The mu-, kappa-, and delta-opioid receptors mediate endogenous and exogenous opioid response in the central nervous system and peripherally in the gastrointestinal system. Agonism of peripheral mu-opioid receptors results in reduced colonic motility, while antagonism of central delta-opioid receptors results in improved analgesia, making eluxadoline usable for the symptoms of both pain and diarrhea characteristic of IBS-D.     Marketed under the tradename Viberzi (FDA), eluxadoline is an antimotility agent that decreases bowel contractions, inhibits colonic transit, and reduces ﬂuid/ion secretion resulting in improved symptoms of abdominal pain and reductions in the Bristol Stool Scale.

CHEBI:8378	prednisolone	Prednisolone is only found in individuals that have used or taken this drug. It is a glucocorticoid with the general properties of the corticosteroids. It is the drug of choice for all conditions in which routine systemic corticosteroid therapy is indicated, except adrenal deficiency states. [PubChem]Glucocorticoids such as Prednisolone can inhibit leukocyte infiltration at the site of inflammation, interfere with mediators of inflammatory response, and suppress humoral immune responses. The antiinflammatory actions of glucocorticoids are thought to involve phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, lipocortins, which control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Prednisolone reduces inflammatory reaction by limiting the capillary dilatation and permeability of the vascular structures. These compounds restrict the accumulation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages and reduce the release of vasoactive kinins. Recent research suggests that corticosteroids may inhibit the release of arachidonic acid from phospholipids, thereby reducing the formation of prostaglandins. Prednisolone is a glucocorticoid receptor agonist. On binding, the corticoreceptor-ligand complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter region of the target genes. The DNA bound receptor then interacts with basic transcription factors, causing an increase or decrease in expression of specific target genes, including suppression of IL2 (interleukin 2) expression.

In the present day, contemporary research regarding novel methods to stabilize mesalazine continues and interest in the agent's capacity to decrease inflammatory activity and subsequently potentially reduce the risk of colorectal cancer in conditions like ulcerative colitis is maintained.[A174019,A174022]
CHEBI:7770	olsalazine	A prodrug of mesalamine (5-Aminosalicylic acid; 5-ASA) with anti-inflammatory activity. Unabsorbed olsalazine passes through gastrointestinal tract and is cleaved by azoreductases, produced by microflora in colon, into 2 active molecules of 5-ASA. 5-ASA exerts its anti-inflammatory action locally by inhibiting cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase activities, thereby reducing the production of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. In addition, mesalamine may act as a scavenger of reactive oxygen free radicals.; UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T109; UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T121
CHEBI:267413	balsalazide	Balsalazide is an anti-inflammatory drug used in the treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Disease. It is sold under the name 'Colazal' in the US and 'Colazide' in the UK. The chemical name is (E)-5-[[-4-(2-carboxyethyl) aminocarbonyl] phenyl]azo] -2-hydroxybenzoic acid. It is usually administered as the disodium salt. Balsalazide releases mesalazine, also known as 5-aminosalicylic acid, or 5-ASA, in the large intestine. Its advantage over that drug in the treatment of Ulcerative colitis is believed to be the delivery of the active agent past the small intestine to the large intestine, the active site of ulcerative colitis.

CHEBI:8080	phentermine	Phentermine is only found in individuals that have used or taken this drug. It is a central nervous system stimulant and sympathomimetic with actions and uses similar to those of dextroamphetamine. It has been used most frequently in the treatment of obesity. [PubChem]Phentermine is an amphetamine that stimulates neurons to release or maintain high levels of a particular group of neurotransmitters known as catecholamines; these include dopamine and norepinephrine. High levels of these catecholamines tend to suppress hunger signals and appetite. The drug seems to inhibit reuptake of noradrenaline, dopamine, and seratonin through inhibition or reversal of the reuptake transporters. It may also inhibit MAO enzymes leaving more neurotransmitter available at the synapse.Phentermine (through catecholamine elevation) may also indirectly affect leptin levels in the brain. It is theorized that phentermine can raise levels of leptin which signal satiety. It is also theorized that increased levels of the catecholamines are partially responsible for halting another chemical messenger known as neuropeptide Y. This peptide initiates eating, decreases energy expenditure, and increases fat storage.
CHEBI:5000	fenfluramine	A  secondary amino compound that is 1-phenyl-propan-2-amine in which one of the meta-hydrogens is substituted by trifluoromethyl, and one of the hydrogens attached to the nitrogen is substituted by an ethyl group. It binds to the serotonin reuptake pump, causing inhbition of serotonin uptake and release of serotonin. The resulting increased levels of serotonin lead to greater serotonin receptor activation which in turn lead to enhancement of serotoninergic transmission in the centres of feeding behavior located in the hypothalamus. This suppresses the appetite for carbohydrates. Fenfluramine was used as the hydrochloride for treatment of diabetes and obesity. It was withdrawn worldwide after reports of heart valve disease and pulmonary hypertension.

CHEBI:439329	(S)-fenfluramine	Dexfenfluramine, also marketed under the name Redux, is a serotoninergic anorectic drug. It was for some years in the mid-1990s approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the purposes of weight loss. However, following multiple concerns about the cardiovascular side-effects of the drug, such approval was withdrawn.
CHEBI:6702	Mazindol	Mazindol is only found in individuals that have used or taken this drug. It is a tricyclic anorexigenic agent unrelated to and less toxic than amphetamine, but with some similar side effects. It inhibits uptake of catecholamines and blocks the binding of cocaine to the dopamine uptake transporter. [PubChem]Although the mechanism of action of the sympathomimetics in the treatment of obesity is not fully known, these medications have pharmacological effects similar to those of amphetamines. Unlike other sympathomimetic appetite suppressants such as phentermine, mazindol is thought to inhibit the reuptake of norepinephrine rather than to cause its release.
CHEBI:134796	etilamfetamine	Etilamfetamine is also known as N-ethylamphetamine and is in the Canadian Legislation - The Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, and is a Schedule 1 controlled drug. Like other amphetamines, this amphetamine analog was used as an appetite suppressant in the 1950s.

In October 2010, Sibutramine was withdrawn from Canadian and U.S. markets due to concerns that the drug increases the risk of heart attack and stroke in patients with a history of heart disease.
CHEBI:65353	lorcaserin	UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T109; UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T121; Lorcaserin (previously APD-356), a highly selective 5HT2C receptor agonist, is used for the treatment of obesity. It has been shown to reduce body weight and food intake in animal models of obesity, and it is thought that targeting the 5HT2C receptor may alter body weight by regulating satiety. Lorcaserin is marketed as a salt form called Belviq, which is lorcaserin hydrochloride.    In February 2020, the FDA issued a Drug Safety Communication requesting the manufacturer of Belviq (lorcaserin hydrochloride tablets, 10 mg) and Belviq XR (lorcaserin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, 20 mg) to voluntarily withdraw these products from the U.S. market, and the company has submitted a request to voluntarily withdraw the drug.

DRUGBANK:DB13198	Pepsin	UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T116; UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T121; UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T126; Pepsin is a potent enzyme in gastric juice that digests proteins such as those in meat, eggs, seeds, and dairy products [L2358].    Studies on gastric digestion from 1820-1840 led to the discovery of pepsin as the substance which, in the presence of stomach acid, causes nutrients including meat or coagulated egg whites to dissolve. Soon afterward, it was shown that these protein nutrients were cleaved by pepsin to products called _peptones_ [A32603].    Pepsin is often used as a replacement enzyme for those with pancreatic insufficiency [L2357]. Stimulation of the pancreas and therefore enzymatic digestion of food is a tightly controlled and is a hormonally mediated process. Any changes or conditions affecting metabolic steps for successful digestion and absorption negatively affect pancreatic enzymatic secretion, entry into the intestine, functionality once inside the intestine, and appropriate mixing with foods/nutrients. Many causes of pancreatic insufficiency require that enzyme replacement therapy is started, including cystic fibrosis, pancreatic cancer, acute and chronic pancreatitis, as well as pancreatic surgery [L2357].    Pepsin is approved by the FDA and is used in food at levels not to exceed current good manufacturing practice [L2363].  Interestingly, it has been used as a marker for laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR), which is a common illness of otolaryngology (ear, nose and throat specialist) visits [A32604].    Interestingly, recent research has suggested that pepsin participates in the digestion of nucleic acids [L2391].

CHEBI:17883	hydrogen chloride	Hydrochloric acid constitutes the majority of gastric acid, the human digestive fluid. In a complex process and at a large energetic burden, it is secreted by parietal cells (also known as oxyntic cells). These cells contain an extensive secretory network (called canaliculi) from which the HCl is secreted into the lumen of the stomach. They are part of the epithelial fundic glands (also known as oxyntic glands) in the stomach. The chemical compound hydrochloric acid is the aqueous (water-based) solution of hydrogen chloride gas (HCl). It is a strong acid, the major component of gastric acid and of wide industrial use. Hydrochloric acid must be handled with appropriate safety precautions because it is a highly corrosive liquid. Hydrochloric acid, or muriatic acid by its historical but still occasionally used name, has been an important and frequently used chemical from early history and was discovered by the alchemist Jabir ibn Hayyan around the year 800. Hydrogen chloride, also known under the name HCl, is a highly corrosive and toxic colorless gas that forms white fumes on contact with humidity. These fumes consist of hydrochloric acid which forms when hydrogen chloride dissolves in water. The hydrogen chloride molecule HCl is a simple diatomic molecule consisting of a hydrogen atom H and a chlorine atom Cl connected with a covalent single bond. Since the chlorine atom is much more electronegative than the hydrogen atom, the covalent bond between the atoms is quite polar. Hydrogen chloride forms corrosive hydrochloric acid on contact with body tissue. Inhalation of the fumes can cause coughing, choking, inflammation of the nose, throat, and upper respiratory tract, and in severe cases, pulmonary edema, circulatory system failure, and death. Skin contact can cause redness, pain, and severe skin burns. Hydrogen chloride may cause severe burns to the eye and permanent eye damage.
CHEBI:30769	citric acid	"Citric acid (citrate) is a tricarboxylic acid, an organic acid with three carboxylate groups.  Citrate is an intermediate in the TCA cycle (also known as the Tricarboxylic Acid cycle, the Citric Acid cycle or Krebs cycle). The TCA cycle is a central metabolic pathway for all animals, plants, and bacteria. As a result, citrate is found in all living organisms, from bacteria to plants to animals. In the TCA cycle, the enzyme citrate synthase catalyzes the condensation of oxaloacetate with acetyl CoA to form citrate. Citrate then acts as the substrate for the enzyme known as aconitase and is then converted into aconitic acid. The TCA cycle ends with regeneration of oxaloacetate. This series of chemical reactions in the TCA cycle is the source of two-thirds of the food-derived energy in higher organisms. Citrate can be transported out of the mitochondria and into the cytoplasm, then broken down into acetyl-CoA for fatty acid synthesis, and into oxaloacetate. Citrate is a positive modulator of this conversion, and allosterically regulates the enzyme acetyl-CoA carboxylase, which is the regulating enzyme in the conversion of acetyl-CoA into malonyl-CoA (the commitment step in fatty acid synthesis). In short, citrate is transported into the cytoplasm, converted into acetyl CoA, which is then converted into malonyl CoA by acetyl CoA carboxylase, which is allosterically modulated by citrate. In mammals and other vertebrates, Citrate is a vital component of bone, helping to regulate the size of apatite crystals (PMID: 21127269). Citric acid is found in citrus fruits, most concentrated in lemons and limes, where it can comprise as much as 8% of the dry weight of the fruit. Citric acid is a natural preservative and is also used to add an acidic (sour) taste to foods and carbonated drinks. Because it is one of the stronger edible acids, the dominant use of citric acid is as a flavoring and preservative in food and beverages, especially soft drinks and candies. Citric acid is an excellent chelating agent, binding metals by making them soluble. It is used to remove and discourage the buildup of limescale from boilers and evaporators. It can be used to treat water, which makes it useful in improving the effectiveness of soaps and laundry detergents. The salts of citric acid (citrates) can be used as anticoagulants due to their calcium chelating ability. Intolerance to citric acid in the diet is known to exist. Little information is available as the condition appears to be rare, but like other types of food intolerance it is often described as a ""pseudo-allergic"" reaction."

Sulfonylureas also increase peripheral glucose utilization, decrease hepatic gluconeogenesis and may increase the number and sensitivity of insulin receptors. Sulfonylureas are associated with weight gain, though less so than insulin. Due to their mechanism of action, sulfonylureas may cause hypoglycemia and require consistent food intake to decrease this risk. The risk of hypoglycemia is increased in elderly, debilitated and malnourished individuals. Chlorpropamide is not recommended for the treatment of NIDDM as it increases blood pressure and the risk of retinopathy (UKPDS-33). Up to 80% of the single oral dose of chlorpropramide is metabolized, likely in the liver; 80-90% of the dose is excreted in urine as unchanged drug and metabolites. Renal and hepatic dysfunction may increase the risk of hypoglycemia.
CHEBI:27999	tolbutamide	"A sulphonylurea hypoglycemic agent with actions and uses similar to those of CHLORPROPAMIDE.

Compared to second-generation sulfonylureas, tolbutamide is more likely to cause adverse effects, such as jaundice. This agent is rapidly metabolized by CYPC29.; A first-generation sulfonylurea with hypoglycemic activity. Tolbutamide binds to and blocks adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive potassium channels on the beta cell membrane of the pancreatic islet tissues. This leads to potassium efflux, which results in depolarization, calcium influx, calcium-calmodulin binding, kinase activation, and release of insulin-containing granules by exocytosis. In addition, tolbutamide may increase the number and affinity of cell surface insulin receptors, thereby enhancing the peripheral response to insulin. Tolbutamide is a CYP2C9 substrate.

CHEBI:5383	glimepiride	UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T109; UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T121; First introduced in 1995, glimepiride is a member of the second-generation sulfonylurea (SU) drug class used for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) to improve glycemic control. Type 2 diabetes is a metabolic disorder with increasing prevalences worldwide; it is characterized by insulin resistance in accordance with progressive β cell failure and long-term microvascular and macrovascular complications that lead to co-morbidities and mortalities. Sulfonylureas are one of the insulin secretagogues widely used for the management of type 2 diabetes to lower blood glucose levels. The main effect of SUs is thought to be effective when residual pancreatic β-cells are present,[A177715] as they work by stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreatic beta cells and they are also thought to exert extra-pancreatic effects, such as increasing the insulin-mediated peripheral glucose uptake.[A177709]     Glimepiride works by stimulating the secretion of insulin granules from pancreatic islet beta cells by blocking ATP-sensitive potassium channels (K<SUB>ATP</SUB> channels) and causing depolarization of the beta cells. Compared to [glipizide], another second SU drug, glimepiride has a longer duration of action. It is sometimes classified as a third-generation SU because it has larger substitutions than other second-generation SUs.[A177703] Compared to other SUs, glimepiride was associated with a lower risk of developing hypoglycemia and weight gain in clinical trials [A177709] as well as fewer cardiovascular effects than other SUs due to minimal effects on ischemic preconditioning of cardiac myocytes.[A177703] It is effective in reducing fasting plasma glucose, postprandial glucose, and glycosylated hemoglobin levels and is considered to be a useful, cost-effective treatment option for managing type 2 diabetes mellitus.[A177703] Glimepiride was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States in 1995 for the treatment of T2DM. It is commonly marketed under the brand name Amaryl as oral tablets and is typically administered once daily.
CHEBI:28052	acetohexamide	Acetohexamide is only found in individuals that have used or taken this drug. It is a sulfonylurea hypoglycemic agent that is metabolized in the liver to 1-hydrohexamide. [PubChem]Sulfonylureas such as acetohexamide bind to an ATP-dependent K<sup>+</sup> channel on the cell membrane of pancreatic beta cells. This inhibits a tonic, hyperpolarizing outflux of potassium, which causes the electric potential over the membrane to become more positive. This depolarization opens voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. The rise in intracellular calcium leads to increased fusion of insulin granulae with the cell membrane, and therefore increased secretion of (pro)insulin.

CHEBI:146188	glymidine	Glycodiazine is used with diet to lower blood glucose by increasing the secretion of insulin from pancreas and increasing the sensitivity of peripheral tissues to insulin. The mechanism of action of glycodiazine in lowering blood glucose appears to be dependent on stimulating the release of insulin from functioning pancreatic beta cells, and increasing sensitivity of peripheral tissues to insulin. Glycodiazine likely binds to ATP-sensitive potassium channel receptors on the pancreatic cell surface, reducing potassium conductance and causing depolarization of the membrane. Membrane depolarization stimulates calcium ion influx through voltage-sensitive calcium channels. This increase in intracellular calcium ion concentration induces the secretion of insulin. It is used for the concomitant use with insulin for the treatment of noninsulin-dependent (type 2) diabetes mellitus.

CHEBI:32300	Voglibose	Voglibose is only found in individuals that have used or taken this drug. Voglibose (INN and USAN) is an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor used for lowering post-prandial blood glucose levels in people with diabetes mellitus. It is made in India by Ranbaxy Labs and sold under the trade name Volix. [Wikipedia]Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors are saccharides that act as competitive inhibitors of enzymes needed to digest carbohydrates: specifically alpha-glucosidase enzymes in the brush border of the small intestines. The membrane-bound intestinal alpha-glucosidases hydrolyze oligosaccharides, trisaccharides, and disaccharides to glucose and other monosaccharides in the small intestine. Acarbose also blocks pancreatic alpha-amylase in addition to inhibiting membrane-bound alpha-glucosidases. Pancreatic alpha-amylase hydrolyzes complex starches to oligosaccharides in the lumen of the small intestine. Inhibition of these enzyme systems reduces the rate of digestion of complex carbohydrates. Less glucose is absorbed because the carbohydrates are not broken down into glucose molecules. In diabetic patients, the short-term effect of these drugs therapies is to decrease current blood glucose levels: the long term effect is a small reduction in hemoglobin-A1c level.

CHEBI:8228	pioglitazone	UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T109; UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T121; Pioglitazone is an antihyperglycemic used as an adjunct to diet, exercise, and other antidiabetic medications to manage type 2 diabetes mellitus.[L11416,L11419,L11422,L11425] It is administered as a racemic mixture, though there is no pharmacologic difference between the enantiomers and they appear to interconvert _in vivo_ with little consequence.[L11416] The thiazolidinedione class of medications, which also includes [rosiglitazone] and [troglitazone], exerts its pharmacological effect primarily by promoting insulin sensitivity and the improved uptake of blood glucose[L11416] via agonism at the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ).[A19757] PPARs are ligand-activated transcription factors that are involved in the expression of more than 100 genes and affect numerous metabolic processes, most notably lipid and glucose homeostasis.[A19759]    Thiazolidinediones, including pioglitazone, have fallen out of favor in recent years due to the presence of multiple adverse effects and warnings regarding their use (e.g. congestive heart failure, bladder cancer) and the availability of safer and more effective alternatives for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.[L11461]
CHEBI:136052	lobeglitazone	Lobeglitazone is an antidiabetic medication from the thiazolidinedione class of drugs. It primarily functions as an insulin sensitizer by binding and activating Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors (PPAR) gamma within fat cells. By activating PPAR-gamma and promoting the binding of insulin at fat cells, lobeglitazone thereby has been shown to reduce blood sugar levels, lower hemoglobain A1C (HbA1C) levels, and improve lipid and liver profiles [A19748]. Unlike [DB01132], which is a dual PPAR agonist at PPAR-alpha and PPAR-gamma, Lobeglitazone is a pure PPAR-alpha agonist.     Lobeglitazone was approved by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (South Korea) in 2013, and is being monitored by postmarketing surveillance until 2019. Lobeglitazone is not approved for use by either the Food and Drug Administration (USA), Health Canada, or by the European Medicines Agency for use in the management of diabetes.

It belongs to the meglitinide class of short-acting insulin secretagogues, which act by binding to β cells of the pancreas to stimulate insulin release. Repaglinide induces an early insulin response to meals decreasing postprandial blood glucose levels. It should only be taken with meals and meal-time doses should be skipped with any skipped meal. Approximately one month of therapy is required before a decrease in fasting blood glucose is seen. Meglitnides may have a neutral effect on weight or cause a slight increase in weight. The average weight gain caused by meglitinides appears to be lower than that caused by sulfonylureas and insulin and appears to occur only in those naïve to oral antidiabetic agents. Due to their mechanism of action, meglitinides may cause hypoglycemia although the risk is thought to be lower than that of sulfonylureas since their action is dependent on the presence of glucose. In addition to reducing postprandial and fasting blood glucose, meglitnides have been shown to decrease glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, which are reflective of the last 8-10 weeks of glucose control. Meglitinides appear to be more effective at lowering postprandial blood glucose than metformin, sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones. Repaglinide is extensively metabolized in the liver and excreted in bile. Repaglinide metabolites do not possess appreciable hypoglycemic activity.

CHEBI:17579	beta-carotene	Beta-Carotene belongs to the class of organic compounds known as carotenes. These are a type of polyunsaturated hydrocarbon molecules containing eight consecutive isoprene units. Carotenes are characterized by the presence of two end-groups (mostly cyclohexene rings, but also cyclopentene rings or acyclic groups) linked by a long branched alkyl chain. Beta-carotene is therefore considered to be an isoprenoid lipid molecule. Beta-carotene is a strongly coloured red-orange pigment abundant in fungi, plants, and fruits. It is synthesized biochemically from eight isoprene units and therefore has 40 carbons. Among the carotenes, beta-carotene is distinguished by having beta-rings at both ends of the molecule. Beta-Carotene is biosynthesized from geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. It is the most common form of carotene in plants. In nature, Beta-carotene is a precursor (inactive form) to vitamin A. Vitamin A is produed via the action of beta-carotene 15,15'-monooxygenase on carotenes. In mammals, carotenoid absorption is restricted to the duodenum of the small intestine and dependent on a class B scavenger receptor (SR-B1) membrane protein, which is also responsible for the absorption of vitamin E. One molecule of beta-carotene can be cleaved by the intestinal enzyme Beta-Beta-carotene 15,15'-monooxygenase into two molecules of vitamin A. Beta-Carotene contributes to the orange color of many different fruits and vegetables. Vietnamese gac and crude palm oil are particularly rich sources, as are yellow and orange fruits, such as cantaloupe, mangoes, pumpkin, and papayas, and orange root vegetables such as carrots and sweet potatoes. Excess beta-carotene is predominantly stored in the fat tissues of the body. The most common side effect of excessive beta-carotene consumption is carotenodermia, a physically harmless condition that presents as a conspicuous orange skin tint arising from deposition of the carotenoid in the outermost layer of the epidermis.

CHEBI:28934	vitamin D2	UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T109; UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T121; UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T127; Ergocalciferol is an inactivated vitamin D analog.[A177526] It is synthesized by some plants in the presence of UVB light.[T577] The production of ergocalciferol was prompted by the identification of dietary deficiency, more specifically vitamin D, as the main causative factor for the development of rickets. Ergocalciferol was isolated for the first time from yeast in 1931 and its structure was elucidated in 1932.[T580]    Ergocalciferol is considered the first vitamin D analog and is differentiated from [cholecalciferol] by the presence of a double bond between C22 and C23 and the presence of a methyl group at C24. These modifications reduce the affinity of ergocalciferol for the vitamin D binding protein resulting in faster clearance, limits its activation, and alters its catabolism.[A177637]    The first approved product containing ergocalciferol under the FDA records was developed by US Pharm Holdings and was FDA approved in 1941.[L6058]
CHEBI:4591	dihydrotachysterol	Dihydrotachysterol is only found in individuals that have used or taken this drug. It is a vitamin D that can be regarded as a reduction product of vitamin D2. [PubChem]Once hydroxylated to 25-hydroxydihydrotachysterol, the modified drug binds to the vitamin D receptor. The bound form of the vitamin D receptor serves as a transcriptional regulator of bone matrix proteins, inducing the expression of osteocalcin and suppressing synthesis of type I collagen. Vitamin D (when bound to the vitamin D receptor)stimulates the expression of a number of proteins involved in transporting calcium from the lumen of the intestine, across the epithelial cells and into blood. This stimulates intestinal calcium absorption and increases renal phosphate excretion. These are functions that are normally carried out by the parathyroid hormone.

Alfacaldisol is activated by the enzyme 25-hydroxylase in the liver to mediate its effects in the body, or most importantly, the kidneys and bones. The pharmacological actions of alfacalcidol are prolonged than vitamin D because a negative feedback mechanism regulates the final activation step of vitamin D in the kidneys.[A175348,A175351]    Alfacalcidol is available in oral and intravenous formulations. In Canada, it is marketed as ONE-ALPHA, which manages hypocalcemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and osteodystrophy in adults with chronic renal failure.[L33284] In approving European countries, alfacalcidol is also indicated for managing nutritional and malabsorptive rickets and osteomalacia, vitamin D-dependent rickets and osteomalacia, and hypophosphataemic vitamin D resistant rickets and osteomalacia.[L33364,L33369]

CHEBI:17154	nicotinamide	Niacinamide, also known as nicotinamide (NAM), is a form of vitamin B3 found in food and used as a dietary supplement and medication. Niacinamide belongs to the class of organic compounds known as nicotinamides. These are heterocyclic aromatic compounds containing a pyridine ring substituted at position 3 by a carboxamide group. Its primary significance is in the prevention and/or cure of blacktongue and pellagra. The structure of nicotinamide consists of a pyridine ring to which a primary amide group is attached in the meta position. It is an amide of nicotinic acid. As an aromatic compound, it undergoes electrophilic substitution reactions and transformations of its two functional groups. Niacinamide and phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate can be converted into nicotinic acid mononucleotide and phosphate by the enzyme nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase. In humans, niacinamide is involved in the metabolic disorder called the nad+ signalling pathway (cancer). Niacinamide is an odorless tasting compound. Outside of the human body, niacinamide is found, on average, in the highest concentration within a few different foods, such as common sages, cow milk, and cocoa beans and in a lower concentration in common pea. Niacinamide has also been detected, but not quantified in several different foods, such as yardlong beans, roselles, apples, oyster mushrooms, and swiss chards. Niacinamide occurs in trace amounts mainly in meat, fish, nuts, and mushrooms, as well as to a lesser extent in some vegetables. It is commonly added to cereals and other foods. Many multivitamins contain 20–30 mg of vitamin B3 and it is also available in higher doses. Most animals cannot manufacture this compound in amounts sufficient to prevent nutritional deficiency and it therefore must be supplemented through dietary intake.

CHEBI:15956	biotin	Biotin is an enzyme co-factor present in minute amounts in every living cell. Biotin is also known as vitamin H or B7 or coenzyme R. It occurs mainly bound to proteins or polypeptides and is abundant in liver, kidney, pancreas, yeast, and milk. Biotin has been recognized as an essential nutrient. Our biotin requirement is fulfilled in part through diet, through endogenous reutilization of biotin and perhaps through capture of biotin generated in the intestinal flora. The utilization of biotin for covalent attachment to carboxylases and its reutilization through the release of carboxylase biotin after proteolytic degradation constitutes the 'biotin cycle'. Biotin deficiency is associated with neurological manifestations, skin rash, hair loss and metabolic disturbances that are thought to relate to the various carboxylase deficiencies (metabolic ketoacidosis with lactic acidosis). It has also been suggested that biotin deficiency is associated with protein malnutrition, and that marginal biotin deficiency in pregnant women may be teratogenic. Biotin acts as a carboxyl carrier in carboxylation reactions. There are four biotin-dependent carboxylases in mammals: those of propionyl-CoA (PCC), 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA (MCC), pyruvate (PC) and acetyl-CoA carboxylases (isoforms ACC-1 and ACC-2). All but ACC-2 are mitochondrial enzymes. The biotin moiety is covalently bound to the epsilon amino group of a Lysine residue in each of these carboxylases in a domain 60-80 amino acids long. The domain is structurally similar among carboxylases from bacteria to mammals. There are four biotin-dependent carboxylases in mammals: those of propionyl-CoA (PCC), 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA (MCC), pyruvate (PC) and acetyl-CoA carboxylases (isoforms ACC-1 and ACC-2). All but ACC-2 are mitochondrial enzymes. The biotin moiety is covalently bound to the epsilon amino group of a Lys residue in each of these carboxylases in a domain 60-80 amino acids long. The domain is structurally similar among carboxylases from bacteria to mammals. Evidence is emerging that biotin participates in processes other than classical carboxylation reactions. Specifically, novel roles for biotin in cell signaling, gene expression, and chromatin structure have been identified in recent years. Human cells accumulate biotin by using both the sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter and monocarboxylate transporter 1. These transporters and other biotin-binding proteins partition biotin to compartments involved in biotin signaling: cytoplasm, mitochondria, and nuclei. The activity of cell signals such as biotinyl-AMP, Sp1 and Sp3, nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, and receptor tyrosine kinases depends on biotin supply. Consistent with a role for biotin and its catabolites in modulating these cell signals, greater than 2000 biotin-dependent genes have been identified in various human tissues. Many biotin-dependent gene products play roles in signal transduction and localize to the cell nucleus, consistent with a role for biotin in cell signaling. Posttranscriptional events related to ribosomal activity and protein folding may further contribute to effects of biotin on gene expression. Finally, research has shown that biotinidase and holocarboxylase synthetase mediate covalent binding of biotin to histones (DNA-binding proteins), affecting chromatin structure; at least seven biotinylation sites have been identified in human histones. Biotinylation of histones appears to play a role in cell proliferation, gene silencing, and the cellular response to DNA repair. Roles for biotin in cell signaling and chromatin structure are consistent with the notion that biotin has a unique significance in cell biology. (PMID: 15992684, 16011464).
CHEBI:17310	pyridoxal	"Pyridoxal is a pyridinecarbaldehyde that is pyridine-4-carbaldehyde bearing methyl, hydroxy and hydroxymethyl substituents at positions 2, 3 and 5 respectively. Pyridoxal, also known as pyridoxaldehyde, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as pyridoxals and derivatives. Pyridoxals and derivatives are compounds containing a pyridoxal moiety, which consists of a pyridine ring substituted at positions 2, 3, 4, and 5 by a methyl group, a hydroxyl group, a carbaldehyde group, and a hydroxymethyl group, respectively. Pyridoxal is one form of vitamin B6. Pyridoxal exists in all living species, ranging from bacteria to humans. In humans, pyridoxal is involved in glycine and serine metabolism. Pyridoxal has been detected, but not quantified in several different foods, such as sourdoughs, lichee, arctic blackberries, watercress, and cottonseeds. Some medically relevant bacteria, such as those in the genera Granulicatella and Abiotrophia, require pyridoxal for growth. This nutritional requirement can lead to the culture phenomenon of satellite growth. In in vitro culture, these pyridoxal-dependent bacteria may only grow in areas surrounding colonies of bacteria from other genera (""satellitism"") that are capable of producing pyridoxal. Pridoxal has a role as a cofactor, a human metabolite, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite, an Escherichia coli metabolite and a mouse metabolite."
CHEBI:17268	myo-inositol	myo-Inositol is an inositol isoform. Inositol is a derivative of cyclohexane with six hydroxyl groups, making it a polyol. It also is known as a sugar alcohol, having exactly the same molecular formula as glucose or other hexoses. Inositol exists in nine possible stereoisomers, of which cis-1,2,3,5-trans-4,6-cyclohexanehexol, or myo-inositol is the most widely occurring form in nature. The other known inositols include scyllo-inositol, muco-inositol, D-chiro-inositol, L-chiro-inositol, neo-inositol, allo-inositol, epi-inositol and cis-inositol. myo-Inositol is found naturally in many foods (particularly in cereals with high bran content) and can be used as a sweetner as it has half the sweetness of sucrose (table sugar). myo-Inositol was once considered a member of the vitamin B complex and given the name: vitamin B8. However, because it is produced by the human body from glucose, it is not an essential nutrient, and therefore cannot be called a vitamin. myo-Inositol is a precursor molecule for a number of secondary messengers including various inositol phosphates. In addition, inositol/myo-inositol is an important component of the lipids known as phosphatidylinositol (PI) phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP). myo-Inositol is synthesized from glucose, via glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) in two steps. First, G-6-P is isomerised by an inositol-3-phosphate synthase enzyme to myo-inositol 1-phosphate, which is then dephosphorylated by an inositol monophosphatase enzyme to give free myo-inositol. In humans, myo-inositol is primarily synthesized in the kidneys at a rate of a few grams per day. myo-Inositol can be used in the management of preterm babies who have or are at a risk of infant respiratory distress syndrome. It is also used as a treatment for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It works by increasing insulin sensitivity, which helps to improve ovarian function and reduce hyperandrogenism. Reduced levels of myo-inositol have been found in the spinal fluid of depressed patients and levels are significantly reduced in brain samples of suicide victims.

CHEBI:31959	pantethine	D-Pantethine, also known as pantetina or pantomin, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as beta amino acids and derivatives. These are amino acids having a (-NH2) group attached to the beta carbon atom. Most vitamin B5 supplements are in the form of calcium pantothenate, a salt of pantothenic acid, with doses in the range of 5 to 10 mg/day. Pantethine is available in the United States as a dietary supplement because of evidence of its health benefits for lowering elevated LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides, and raising HDL-cholesterol (the 'good' cholesterol). In contrast, pantethine is sold as a dietary supplement for lowering blood cholesterol and triglycerides at doses of 500 to 1200 mg/day. These clinical trials were conducted with daily intakes ranging from 600 to 1200 mg/day. Pantethine (bis-pantethine or co-enzyme pantethine) is a dimeric form of pantetheine, which is produced from pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) by the addition of cysteamine. D-Pantethine is a drug. Pantetheine is an intermediate in the production of coenzyme A by the body. In multiple clinical trials of patients with elevated cholesterol and triglycerides, total and LDL cholesterol were decreased by an average of 12%, triglycerides decreased by 19%, and HDL cholesterol was increased by 9%. Pantethine is composed of two molecules of pantetheine linked by a bridging disulfide. Most of the literature on pantethine and lipids is 20 to 30 years old, but recent carefully controlled trials of 600 and 900 mg/d doses have shown similar statistically significant lowering of LDL cholesterol in individuals with greatly or moderately elevated levels of blood lipids. A few trials conducted in Japan tested 300 mg/day and reported decreases in total cholesterol of about 4%, increases in HDL-cholesterol of 5% and inconsistent results for triglycerides. Direct dose-response evidence is not available because no trial tested more than one dose. Within this dose range there is no evidence of a dose-effect relationship, i.e. changes in lipid concentrations overlapped across the range of doses.

CHEBI:22984	calcium atom	Calcium is essential for the normal growth and maintenance of bones and teeth, and calcium requirements must be met throughout life. Requirements are greatest during periods of growth, such as childhood, during pregnancy and when breast-feeding. Long-term calcium deficiency can lead to osteoporosis, in which the bone deteriorates and there is an increased risk of fractures. Adults need between 1,000 and 1,300 mg of calcium in their daily diet. Calcium is essential for living organisms, particularly in cell physiology, and is the most common metal in many animals. Physiologically, it exists as an ion in the body. Calcium combines with phosphorus to form calcium phosphate in the bones and teeth. It is essential for the normal functioning of nerves and muscles and plays a role in blood coagulation (as factor IV) and in many enzymatic processes. Calcium is an important component of a healthy diet. A deficit can affect bone and tooth formation, while overretention can cause kidney stones. Vitamin D is needed to absorb calcium. Dairy products, such as milk and cheese, are a well-known source of calcium. However, some individuals are allergic to dairy products and even more people, particularly those of non-European descent, are lactose-intolerant, leaving them unable to consume dairy products. Fortunately, many other good sources of calcium exist. These include: seaweeds such as kelp, wakame and hijiki; nuts and seeds (like almonds and sesame); beans; amaranth; collard greens; okra; rutabaga; broccoli; kale; and fortified products such as orange juice and soy milk. Calcium has also been found to assist in the production of lymphatic fluids.

CHEBI:9249	stanozolol	Stanozolol is only found in individuals that have used or taken this drug. Stanozolol has is a synthetic anabolic steroid with therapeutic uses in treating hereditary angioedema. Stanozolol was first synthesized by Clinton et al. in 1959, as a heterocyclic anabolic androgenic steroid. The structure of Stanozolol differs from endogenous steroid hormones and most commercially available anabolic steroids. It most closely resembles methyl testosterone. Instead of the 3-ketogroup in methyltestosterone, there is a pyrazole ring fused to the androstane ring system. This slightly different structure has the disadvantage of making extraction and isolation of the molecule from matrices more difficult. Like most other anabolic steroids, Stanozolol has poor gas chromatographic behavior and is difficult to detect in urine, because of renal clearance and low urinary excretion. This is due to the rapid metabolization, leading to low concentration levels of the parent compound found in urine. Therefore, most research studies had focused on the detection of urinary metabolites. Androgens are drugs, derived from the natural male sex hormone testosterone, with high anabolic potential and minimized androgenic activity. It has been abused by several high profile professional athletes. Stanozolol binds to androgen receptors, such as membrane bound receptor proteins LAGS and stanozolol-binding protein (STBP). Anabolic steroids stimulate protein synthesis, resulting in an acceleration of the food conversion rate and increasing muscle growth, body mass and enhanced performance. Androgens can be used as therapeutics, because they accelerate the recovery of protein deficiency and protein-wasting disorders (e.g. osteoporosis), but they are also widely abused in doping, as well in animals as in men.

CHEBI:28689	dehydroepiandrosterone	Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is a natural steroid hormone produced from cholesterol by the adrenal glands. DHEA is also produced in the gonads, adipose tissue, and the brain. DHEA is structurally similar to and is a precursor of, androstenedione, testosterone, estradiol, estrone, and estrogen. It is the most abundant hormone in the human body. Most of DHEA is sulfated (dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate or DHEA-S) before secretion. DHEA-S is the sulfated version of DHEA; this conversion is reversibly catalyzed by sulfotransferase (SULT2A1) primarily in the adrenals, the liver, and small intestines. In blood, most DHEA is found as DHEA-S with levels that are about 300 times higher than free DHEA.

CHEBI:16347	(R)-carnitine	"Carnitine is not an essential amino acid; it can be synthesized in the body. However, it is so important in providing energy to muscles (including the heart) that some researchers are now recommending carnitine supplements in the diet, particularly for people who do not consume much red meat (the main food source for carnitine). Carnitine has been described as a vitamin, an amino acid, or a metabimin (i.e. an essential metabolite). Like the B vitamins, carnitine contains nitrogen and is very soluble in water, and to some researchers carnitine is a vitamin (Liebovitz 1984). It was found that an animal (yellow mealworm) could not grow without carnitine in its diet. However, as it turned out, almost all other animals, including humans, do make their own carnitine; thus, it is no longer considered a vitamin. Nevertheless, in certain circumstances, such as deficiencies of methionine, lysine, or vitamin C or kidney dialysis, carnitine shortages develop. Under these conditions, carnitine must be absorbed from food, and for this reason it is sometimes referred to as a ""metabimin"" or a conditionally essential metabolite. Like the other amino acids used or manufactured by the body, carnitine is an amine. But like choline, which is sometimes considered to be a B vitamin, carnitine is also an alcohol (specifically, a trimethylated carboxy-alcohol). Thus, carnitine is an unusual amino acid and has different functions than most other amino acids, which are usually employed by the body in the construction of protein. Carnitine is an essential factor in fatty acid metabolism in mammals. Its most important known metabolic function is to transport fat into the mitochondria of muscle cells, including those in the heart, for oxidation. This is how the heart gets most of its energy. In humans, about 25% of carnitine is synthesized in the liver, kidney, and brain from the amino acids lysine and methionine. Most of the carnitine in the body comes from dietary sources such as red meat and dairy products. Inborn errors of carnitine metabolism can lead to brain deterioration like that of Reye's syndrome, gradually worsening muscle weakness, Duchenne-like muscular dystrophy, and extreme muscle weakness with fat accumulation in muscles. Borum et al. (1979) describe carnitine as an essential nutrient for pre-term babies and individuals who are unable to eat a normal diet (e.g. non-ketotic hypoglycemics, kidney dialysis patients) (PMID: 115309). In conditions such as kwashiorkor, cirrhosis, and heart muscle disease (cardiomyopathy) as well as in inborn errors of metabolism such as type IV hyperlipidemia and propionic or organic aciduria (acid urine resulting from genetic or other anomalies), carnitine is essential to life and carnitine supplements are valuable. Carnitine therapy may also be useful in a wide variety of clinical conditions. Carnitine supplementation has improved some patients who have angina secondary to coronary artery disease. It may also be worth a trial for patients with any form of hyperlipidemia or muscle weakness. Carnitine supplements may also be useful in many forms of toxic or metabolic liver disease and in cases of heart muscle disease. Hearts undergoing severe arrhythmia quickly deplete their stores of carnitine. Athletes, particularly in Europe, have used carnitine supplements for improved endurance. Carnitine may improve muscle building by improving fat utilization and may even be useful in treating obesity. Carnitine joins a long list of nutrients which may be of value in treating pregnant women, hypothyroid individuals, and male infertility due to the low motility of sperm. Carnitine deficiency is noted in abnormal liver function, renal dialysis patients, and severe to moderate muscular weakness with associated anorexia (http://www.dcnutrition.com). Carnitine is a biomarker for the consumption of meat."

CHEBI:17141	cysteamine	Cysteamine is a product of the constitutive degradation of coenzyme A, a process that occurs in all tissues, although some tissues such as brain and heart may have exceptionally high coenzyme A turnover rates. Cysteamine has only one known function, and that is as a precursor for the formation of hypotaurine, which is subsequently oxidized to taurine. The rate of cysteamine production as a result of coenzyme A breakdown is not well understood but it is clear that cysteamine levels are not as dramatically affected by dietary habits as are cysteine levels. Cysteamine is generated from hypotaurine by cysteamine dioxygenase (EC:1.13.11.19), an enzyme that was recently identified in mammals (PMID: 17581819). Cysteamine is the simplest stable aminothiol found in the body. It is used in the treatment of disorders of cystine excretion. Cysteamine cleaves the disulfide bond with cysteine to produce molecules that can escape the metabolic defect in cystinosis and cystinuria. Cyst(e)amine may also serve as an endogenous regulator of immune system activity as well as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of Huntington disease. Cysteamine is also used as a radiation-protective agent that oxidizes in air to form cystamine. It can be given intravenously or orally to treat radiation sickness. -- Wikipedia.

UNII:TL60C27RLH	METRELEPTIN	UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T116; UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T121; UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T125; Metreleptin, a recombinant analog of the human hormone leptin, is an orphan drug used to treat complications of leptin deficiency in people with congenital or acquired lipodystrophy. Affecting less than 500 people worldwide, lipodystrophy is characterized by a lack of adipose tissue, fat deposition in the muscles and liver, and metabolic complications such as hypertriglyceridemia, insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus, and fatty liver disease. These metabolic abnormalities are often aggravated by excessive food intake, which is further aggravated by leptin deficiency, a protein secreted by adipose tissue. Administration of Metreleptin results in improvement of metabolic symptoms including improvements in insulin resistance, reduced HbA1c and fasting glucose, reduced triglycerides, and reductions in food intake. Metreleptin is produced in E. coli and differs from native human leptin by the addition of a methionine residue at its amino terminus. It is administered as a once daily subcutaneous injection. On Feb. 24, 2014, Metreleptin was approved by the FDA for the treatment of complications of leptin deficiency, in addition to diet, in patients with congenital generalized or acquired generalized lipodystrophy. Metreleptin is marketed under the brand Myalept® by Aegerion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

CHEBI:29105	zinc(2+)	Zinc is an essential element, necessary for sustaining all life.Physiologically, it exists as an ion in the body. It is estimated that 3000 of the hundreds of thousands of proteins in the human body contain zinc prosthetic groups. In addition, there are over a dozen types of cells in the human body that secrete zinc ions, and the roles of these secreted zinc signals in medicine and health are now being actively studied. Intriguingly, brain cells in the mammalian forebrain are one type of cell that secretes zinc, along with its other neuronal messenger substances. Cells in the salivary gland, prostate, immune system and intestine are other types that secrete zinc. Obtaining a sufficient zinc intake during pregnancy and in young children is a problem, especially among those who cannot afford a good and varied diet. Brain development is stunted by zinc deficiency in utero and in youth. Zinc is an activator of certain enzymes, such as carbonic anhydrase. Carbonic anhydrase is important in the transport of carbon dioxide in vertebrate blood. Even though zinc is an essential requirement for a healthy body, too much zinc can be harmful. Excessive absorption of zinc can also suppress copper and iron absorption. The free zinc ion in solution is highly toxic to plants, invertebrates, and even vertebrate fish. The Free Ion Activity Model (FIAM) is well-established in the literature, and shows that just micromolar amounts of the free ion kills some organisms.

CHEBI:230846	Pegvaliase	UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T116; UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T121; Pegvaliase is a recombinant phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) enzyme derived from _Anabaena variabilis_ that converts phenylalanine to ammonia and _trans_-cinnamic acid [A33284]. Both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency approved pegvaliase-pqpz in May 2018 for the treatment of adult patients with phenylketonuria (PKU). Phenylketonuria is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that is characterized by deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) [A33284] and affects about 1 in 10,000 to 15,000 people in the United States [L2925]. PAH deficiency and inability to break down an amino acid phenylalanine (Phe) leads to elevated blood phenylalanine concentrations and accumulation of neurotoxic Phe in the brain, causing chronic intellectual, neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disabilities if untreated [A33284]. Individuals with PKU also need to be under a strictly restricted diet as Phe is present in foods and products with high-intensity sweeteners [L2925]. The primary goal of lifelong treatment of PKU, as recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines, is to maintain blood Phe concentration in the range of 120 µmol/L to 3690 µmol/L [A33286].     Pegvaliase-pqpz, or PEGylated pegvaliase, is used as a novel enzyme substitution therapy and is marketed as Palynziq for subcutaneous injection. Pegvaliase-pqpz is a homotetrameric protein composed of recombinant phenylalanine ammonia lyase (rAvPAL) conjugated to N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)-methoxypolyethylene glycol (PEG).[L42725] It is advantageous over currently available management therapies for PKU, such as [DB00360], that are ineffective to many patients due to long-term adherence issues or inadequate Phe-lowering effects [A33284].

CHEBI:31221	Anetholtrithion	UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T109; UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T121; Anethole trithione (ATT) appears to have a broad range of unique functions, from increasing salivary secretion to help treat xerostomia [A27165, A32618, A32620, A32621], to demonstrating an ability to inhibit carcinogenesis by increasing the activity of electrophile detoxification enzymes [A32619], and even being used as an adjunctive therapy for cholecystitis, gallstone, indigestion, and acute/chronic hepatitis [L2388] and is marketed in certain countries like France, Germany, and China [A32614].    Unfortunately, many of the specific mechanisms of action to these activities have yet to be formally elucidated, which means that while studies are ongoing, ATT itself is not necessarily formally indicated for many of these aforementioned functions at this time and is only used in limited regions around the world.
CHEBI:41500	4-phenylbutyric acid	Benzenebutanoic acid (also known as 4-phenylbutyrate, or 4-PBA) is the oral form of butyrate, which is known to be a transcriptional regulator. Sodium-4-PBA has been shown to induce fetal hemoglobin, and it has been used in clinical trials for sickle cell anemia and &#946;-thalassemia. Because gene expression profiles became more differentiated, it is in phase I trials in several different malignant disorders. The potential for therapeutic benefit in cystic fibrosis (CF) resides in an additional mechanism, involving protein folding and the ER (endoplasmic reticulum) environment (PMID 12458151). 4-PBA is a drug that was developed to treat elevated blood ammonia in urea cycle disorders, a histone deacetylase inhibitor that promotes mutation &#916;F508 cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) trafficking (PMID 16798551).

CHEBI:50381	miglustat	UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T109; UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T121; Miglustat, commonly marketed under the trade name Zavesca, is a drug used to treat Gaucher disease. It inhibits the enzyme glucosylceramide synthase, an essential enzyme for the synthesis of most glycosphingolipids. It is only used for patients who cannot be treated with enzyme replacement therapy with imiglucerase. Miglustat is now the first and only approved therapy for patients with Niemann-Pick disease type C (NP-C). It has recently been approved for treatment of progressive neurological symptoms in adult and pediatric patients in the European Union, Brazil, and South Korea. Miglustat was first developed as an anti-HIV agent in the 1990s. However, clinical experience with miglustat showed that therapeutic levels of the drug could not be achieved in patients without a high incidence of adverse effect.

CHEBI:72305	teduglutide	UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T116; UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T121; Teduglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) analogue. It is made up of 33 amino acids and is manufactured using a strain of Escherichia coli modified by recombinant DNA technology. Teduglutide differs from GLP-2 by one amino acid (alanine is substituted by glycine). The significance of this substitution is that teduglutide is longer acting than endogenous GLP-2 as it is more resistant to proteolysis from dipeptidyl peptidase-4. FDA approved on December 21, 2012.

CHEBI:82752	eliglustat	UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T109; UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T121; Eliglustat is a glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor used for the long-term treatment of type 1 Gaucher disease.[A3752,L41404] Gaucher disease is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the deficiency of acid β-glucosidase, an enzyme that converts glucosylceramide into glucose and ceramide. In patients with Gaucher disease, the accumulation of glucosylceramide leads to the formation of Gaucher cells that infiltrate the liver, spleen, bone marrow and other organs. This leads to complications such as anemia and thrombocytopenia.[L41404,A246384] By inhibiting glucosylceramide synthase, eliglustat reduces the accumulation of glucosylceramide.[L41404]    Eliglustat is mainly metabolized by CYP2D6.[L41404] Patients selected for eliglustat treatment undergo an FDA-cleared genotyping test to establish if they are CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (EMs), intermediate metabolizers (IMs), or poor metabolizers (PMs). The results of this test dictate eliglustat dosing recommendations for each type of patient. There are no dosing recommendations for CYP2D6 ultra-rapid or indeterminate metabolizers.[L41404,A7634] Eliglustat was approved by the FDA in August 2014 as an oral substrate reduction therapy for the first-line treatment of type 1 Gaucher disease.[L41404,A7634] Enzyme replacement continues to be the standard of care for the treatment of type 1 Gaucher disease ([imiglucerase], [velaglucerase alfa], [taliglucerase alfa]); however, oral substrate reduction therapies with favourable safety profiles, such as eliglustat, represent a treatment alternative.[A246389,A7634]
CHEBI:30746	benzoic acid	Benzoic acid, C6H5COOH, is a colourless crystalline solid and the simplest aromatic carboxylic acid. Benzoic acid occurs naturally free and bound as benzoic acid esters in many plant and animal species. Appreciable amounts have been found in most berries (around 0.05%). Cranberries contain as much as 300-1300 mg free benzoic acid per kg fruit. Benzoic acid is a fungistatic compound that is widely used as a food preservative. It often is conjugated to glycine in the liver and excreted as hippuric acid. Benzoic acid is a byproduct of phenylalanine metabolism in bacteria. It is also produced when gut bacteria process polyphenols (from ingested fruits or beverages). It can be found in Serratia (PMID:23061754).

CHEBI:90914	uridine triacetate	UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T114; UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T121; Uridine triacetate, formerly known as vistonuridine, is an orally active prodrug of the naturally occurring nucleoside uridine. It is used for the treatment of hereditary orotic aciduria (Xuriden), or for the emergency treatment of fluorouracil or capecitabine overdose or toxicity (Vistogard).  It is provided in the prodrug form as uridine triacetate as this form delivers 4- to 6-fold more uridine into the systemic circulation compared to equimolar doses of uridine itself.     When used for the treatment or prevention of toxicity associated with fluorouracil and other antimetabolites, uridine triacetate is utilized for its ability to compete with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) metabolites for incorporation into the genetic material of non-cancerous cells. It reduces toxicity and cell-death associated with two cytotoxic intermediates: 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-monophosphate (FdUMP) and 5-fluorouridine triphosphate (FUTP). Normally, FdUMP inhibits thymidylate synthase required for thymidine synthesis and DNA replication and repair while FUTP incorporates into RNA resulting in defective strands. As a result, these metabolites are associated with various unpleasant side effects such as neutropenia, mucositis, diarrhea, and hand–foot syndrome. Like many other neoplastic agents, these side effects limit the doses of 5-FU that can be administered, which also affects the efficacy for treatment. By pre-administering with uridine (as the prodrug uridine triacetate), higher doses of 5-FU can be given allowing for improved efficacy and a reduction in toxic side effects [A18578]. It can also be used as a rescue therapy if severe side effects present within 96 hours after initiation of therapy.     Uridine triacetate is also used for the treatment of hereditary orotic aciduria, also known as uridine monophosphate synthase deficiency. This rare congenital autosomal recessive disorder of pyrimidine metabolism is caused by a defect in uridine monophosphate synthase (UMPS), a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the final two steps of the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway. As a result of UMPS deficiency, patients experience a  systemic deficiency of pyrimidine nucleotides, accounting for most symptoms of the disease. Additionally, orotic acid from the de novo pyrimidine pathway that cannot be converted to UMP is excreted in the urine, accounting for the common name of the disorder, orotic aciduria. Furthermore, orotic acid crystals in the urine can cause episodes of obstructive uropathy. When administered as the prodrug uridine triacetate, uridine can be used by essentially all cells to make uridine nucleotides, which compensates for the genetic deficiency in synthesis in patients with hereditary orotic aciduria. When intracellular uridine nucleotides are restored into the normal range, overproduction of orotic acid is reduced by feedback inhibition, so that urinary excretion of orotic acid is also reduced.
CHEBI:135923	migalastat	UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T109; UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T121; Fabry disease is a rare, progressive genetic disorder characterized by a defective GLA gene that causes a deficiency in the enzyme alpha-Galactosidase A (alpha-Gal A) [FDA Label, F1107, L4274, L4263]. This enzyme is responsible for breaking down glycosphingolipid substrate that, when deficient in patients with Fabry disease, builds up in the blood vessels, the kidneys, the nerves, the heart, and other organs [FDA Label, F1107, L4274, L4278]. In the U.S., it is estimated that more than 3,000 people are living with Fabry disease, and an estimated more than 50 percent of these diagnosed patients are currently untreated [L4274].    Migalastat (approved and sold under Amicus Therapeutics' brand name Galafold) is subsequently an oral pharmacological chaperone of alpha-Gal A for the treatment of Fabry disease in adults who have amenable GLA variants [FDA Label, F1107, L4274, L4278]. In these patients, migalastat works by stabilizing the body’s own dysfunctional alpha-Gal A enzyme so that it can clear the accumulation of glycosphingolipid disease substrate [FDA Label, F1107, L4274, L4278]. Globally, it is estimated that approximately 35 to 50 percent of Fabry patients may have amenable GLA variants that are treatable with migalastat [L4274].    Given the rarity of Fabry disease and the proportion of Fabry disease patients that could benefit from migalastat therapy, Amicus Therapeutics' brand name Galafold was approved using the Accelerated Approval pathway, under which the FDA may approve drugs for serious conditions where there is an unmet medical need and where a drug is shown to have certain effects that are reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit to patients [FDA Label, F1107, L4274, L4278]. A further study is required to verify and describe the clinical benefits of Galafold, and the sponsor will be conducting a confirmatory clinical trial of Galafold in adults with Fabry disease [FDA Label, F1107, L4274, L4278].    Additionally, Galafold was alzo granted Priority Review designation, under which the FDA’s goal is to take action on an application within six months of application filing where the agency determines that the drug, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in treating, diagnosing or preventing a serious condition over available therapies [FDA Label, F1107]. Galafold also received Orphan Drug designation, which provides incentives to assist and encourage the development of drugs for rare diseases [FDA Label, F1107].    As of August 2018, migalastat under Amicus Therapeutics' brand name Galafold is currently approved in Australia, Canada, European Union, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Switzerland, and the United States.
CHEBI:177736	Telotristat	UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T109; UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T121; Telotristat ethyl is a prodrug of telotristat that was approved by the FDA in March 2017 as Xermelo.[L43342] It was previously referred to as telotristat etiprate, the hippurate salt form; however, the FDA recommends the use of the name of the neutral form rather than that of the salt.[A252937, A252942] Currently, telotristat ethyl is used to treat carcinoid syndrome diarrhea from neuroendocrine tumors that are inadequately controlled by short-acting somatostatin analog (SSA) treatment.[L43342]     Neuroendocrine cells are cells that secrete regulatory peptides and biogenic amines in response to chemical, neural, or other types of stimuli.[A252947] Neuroendocrine tumors (NET) arising from these cells can therefore secrete chemical mediators into the bloodstream to cause side effects in distant sites, a phenomenon called carcinoid syndrome.[A252947] The most common peptides and amines secreted by NET are histamines, tachykinins, kallikrein, and serotonin.[L43367] Overexposure to serotonin can cause severe diarrhea, one of the main clinical symptoms of carcinoid syndrome.[A252937] Serotonin is metabolized in the urinary metabolite 5-hydroxy indole acetic acid (u5-HIAA), and high levels of u5-HIAA is associated with poor survival outcome in patients with NET.[A252937] The first line treatment of carcinoid syndrome diarrhea is SSA, but symptoms still reoccur over the course of the disease.[A252937]
UNII:ROV204583W	GIVOSIRAN	A proprietary enhanced stabilization chemistry (ESC)-stabilized conjugate composed of the liver-targeted ligand N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) conjugated to small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) directed against the liver-expressed enzyme aminolevulinic acid synthase 1 (delta-aminolevulinate synthase 1; ALAS1; ALAS-1) that can potentially be used in the treatment of acute hepatic porphyrias (AHPs). Upon subcutaneous administration of givosiran, the GalNAc moiety targets and binds with high affinity to asialoglycoprotein receptors (ASGPRs) expressed on hepatocytes. Once inside the cell, the siRNAs bind to and silence ALAS1 mRNA and inhibit both the translation and expression of the ALAS1 protein. This prevents delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) formation, decreases 5-ALA levels and prevents the production of porphyrins and hemes, such as porphobilinogen (PBG). AHPs are a group of metabolic disorders caused by deficiencies of specific enzymes that are responsible for hemoglobulin biosynthesis within the liver, which leads to the accumulation of toxic intermediates, such as ALA and PBG. ALAS1, a liver-expressed, rate-limiting enzyme in the heme biosynthesis pathway, is responsible for the formation of ALA from succinyl-CoA and glycine.

CHEBI:60210	precursor Z hydrate	Cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate, also known as CPMP or precursor Z, hydrated, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as pyranopterins and derivatives. These are pterin derivatives in which a pyran ring is fused either to the pyrimidine ring or the pyrazine ring of the pterin moiety. Cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate is slightly soluble (in water) and an extremely strong acidic compound (based on its pKa). Cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate exists in all living organisms, ranging from bacteria to humans. Cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate participates in a number of enzymatic reactions. In particular, Cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate can be biosynthesized from guanosine triphosphate; which is mediated by the enzyme molybdopterin biosynthesis protein a. In addition, Cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate can be converted into molybdopterin through its interaction with the enzyme molybdopterin synthase. Outside of the human body, cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate can be found in a number of food items such as jew's ear, pepper (c. baccatum), mexican groundcherry, and black cabbage. This makes cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products. Cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate is part of the Cofactor biosynthesis, Folate biosynthesis, and Sulfur relay system pathways. It is a substrate for: Molybdopterin synthase catalytic subunit.

It is also used in biochemical experiments as an inhibitor of reductases.; A hydroxycoumarin originally isolated from molding sweet-clover hay, with anticoagulant and vitamin K depletion activities. Dicumarol is a competitive inhibitor of vitamin K epoxide reductase; thus, it inhibits vitamin K recycling and causes depletion of active vitamin K in blood.

CHEBI:8066	phenindione	Phenindione is only found in individuals that have used or taken this drug. It is an indandione that has been used as an anticoagulant. Phenindione has actions similar to warfarin, but it is now rarely employed because of its higher incidence of severe adverse effects. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p234)Phenindione inhibits vitamin K reductase, resulting in depletion of the reduced form of vitamin K (vitamin KH2). As vitamin K is a cofactor for the carboxylation of glutamate residues on the N-terminal regions of vitamin K-dependent proteins, this limits the gamma-carboxylation and subsequent activation of the vitamin K-dependent coagulant proteins. The synthesis of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X and anticoagulant proteins C and S is inhibited. Depression of three of the four vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors (factors II, VII, and X) results in decreased prothrombin levels and a decrease in the amount of thrombin generated and bound to fibrin. This reduces the thrombogenicity of clots.
CHEBI:10033	warfarin	a blood thinner; An anticoagulant that acts by inhibiting the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors. Warfarin is indicated for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of venous thrombosis and its extension, pulmonary embolism, and atrial fibrillation with embolization.

CHEBI:15552	prostaglandin I2	Prostaglandin I2 or prostacyclin (or PGI2) is a member of the family of lipid molecules known as eicosanoids. It is produced in endothelial cells from prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) by the action of the enzyme prostacyclin synthase. It is a powerful vasodilator and inhibits platelet aggregation. Prostaglandin I2 is the main prostaglandin synthesized by the blood vessel wall. This suggests that it may play an important role in limiting platelet-mediated thrombosis. In particular, prostacyclin (PGI2) chiefly prevents formation of the platelet plug involved in primary hemostasis (a part of blood clot formation). The sodium salt (known as epoprostenol) has been used to treat primary pulmonary hypertension. Prostacyclin (PGI2) is released by healthy endothelial cells and performs its function through a paracrine signaling cascade that involves G protein-coupled receptors on nearby platelets and endothelial cells. The platelet Gs protein-coupled receptor (prostacyclin receptor) is activated when it binds to PGI2. This activation, in turn, signals adenylyl cyclase to produce cAMP. cAMP goes on to inhibit any undue platelet activation (in order to promote circulation) and also counteracts any increase in cytosolic calcium levels which would result from thromboxane A2 (TXA2) binding (leading to platelet activation and subsequent coagulation). PGI2 also binds to endothelial prostacyclin receptors and in the same manner raise cAMP levels in the cytosol. This cAMP then goes on to activate protein kinase A (PKA). PKA then continues the cascade by inhibiting myosin light-chain kinase which leads to smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation. Notably, PGI2 and TXA2 work as antagonists. PGI2 is stable in basic buffers (pH=8), but it is rapidly hydrolyzed to 6-keto PGF1alpha in neutral or acidic solutions. The half-life is short both in vivo and in vitro, ranging from 30 seconds to a few minutes. PGI2 is administered by continuous infusion in humans for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary hypertension.Prostaglandins are eicosanoids. The eicosanoids consist of the prostaglandins (PGs), thromboxanes (TXs), leukotrienes (LTs), and lipoxins (LXs). The PGs and TXs are collectively identified as prostanoids. Prostaglandins were originally shown to be synthesized in the prostate gland, thromboxanes from platelets (thrombocytes), and leukotrienes from leukocytes, hence the derivation of their names. All mammalian cells except erythrocytes synthesize eicosanoids. These molecules are extremely potent, able to cause profound physiological effects at very dilute concentrations. All eicosanoids function locally at the site of synthesis, through receptor-mediated G-protein linked signalling pathways.

CHEBI:87715	prasugrel	Prasugrel, a thienopyridine derivative, is a platelet activation and aggregation inhibitor structurally and pharmacologically related to clopidogrel and ticlopidine. Similar to clopidogrel, prasugrel is a prodrug that requires enzymatic transformation in the liver to its active metabolite, R-138727. R-138727 irreversibly binds to P2Y12 type ADP receptors on platelets thereby inhibiting ADP-mediated platelet activation and aggregation. Prasugrel inhibits ADP-mediated platelet aggregation more rapidly, more consistently and to a greater extent (at least 30%) than clopidogrel. The increased potency of prasugrel appears to be due to more efficient conversion to its active metabolite. The relationship, however, between increased platelet aggregation and clinical response has not been determined. Prasugrel carries a higher risk of bleed compared to clopidogrel, which may be a result of its higher potency. Prasugrel was developed by Daiichi Sankyo Co. and is currently marketed in the United States and Canada in cooperation with Eli Lilly and Company for acute coronary syndromes planned for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

CHEBI:90841	cangrelor	Cangrelor (trade name: Kengreal (US), Kengrexal (Europe)) is a P2Y12 antagonist FDA approved as an antiplatelet drug that is administered intravenously to reduce ischemic events (i.e. restricted blood flow) in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). PCI, also known as coronary angioplasty, is a nonsurgical procedure which opens blocked or narrowed coronary arteries that are clogged due to a buildup of plaque. Being an adenosine triphosphate (ATP) analogue, cangrelor is able to bind the adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor P2Y12 and inhibit ADP-mediated platelet activation and aggregation. An advantage cangrelor provides over oral P2Y12 inhibitors (e.g. clopidogrel, ticagrelor, ticlopidine, and prasugrel) is that it is an active drug not requiring hepatic conversion, therefore, providing a rapid onset and offset of action (PMID: 27729681).

By inhibiting factor Xa, a key protein in the coagulation cascade, edoxaban prevents the stepwise amplification of protein factors needed to form blood clots. It is indicated to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism (SE) in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) and for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) following 5-10 days of initial therapy with a parenteral anticoagulant. Traditionally, warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, was used for stroke prevention in these individuals but effective use of this drug is limited by it's delayed onset, narrow therapeutic window, need for regular monitoring and INR testing, and numerous drug-drug and drug-food interactions. This has prompted enthusiasm for newer agents such as dabigatran, apixaban, and rivaroxaban for effective clot prevention.

UNII:SCK81AMR7R	THROMBIN ALFA	UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T116; UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T121; UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T123; UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T126; Also known as coagulation factor II, thrombin is a serine protease that plays a physiological role in regulating hemostasis and maintaining blood coagulation. Once converted from prothrombin, thrombin converts fibrinogen to fibrin, which, in combination with platelets from the blood, forms a clot.    Medical thrombin is a protein substance produced through a conversion reaction in which prothrombin of bovine origin is activated by tissue thromboplastin in the presence of calcium chloride. Thrombin requires no intermediate physiological agent for its action. It clots the fibrinogen of the blood directly. Failure to clot blood occurs in the rare case where the primary clotting defect is the absence of fibrinogen itself.    Bovine thrombin however, is capable of causing fatal severe bleeding or thrombosis [FDA Label]. This thrombosis may result from the development of antibodies against bovine thrombin [FDA Label]. Bleeding may result from the development of antibodies against bovine factor V [FDA Label]. These antibodies may subsequently cross-react with endogenous human factor V and lead to its deficiency [FDA Label]. Patients who are know or suspected to have antibodies to bovine thrombin and/or bovine factor V should not be re-exposed to the product [FDA Label]. Patients who are administered bovine thrombin should be monitored for abnormal coagulation laboratory values, bleeding, or indeed, thrombosis [FDA Label].    A variety of human thrombin and recombinant thrombin (ie. thrombin alfa) products are available as alternatives to using bovine thrombin.

The von Willebrand factor has receptors for collagen, platelets, and ristocetin activity as well as the immunologically distinct antigenic determinants. It functions in adhesion of platelets to collagen and hemostatic plug formation.

UNII:NU23Q531G1	CATRIDECACOG	UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T116; UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T121; UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T123; Coagulation Factor XIII A-Subunit (Recombinant), also known as catridecacog, is a recombinant form of the Factor XIII-A2 homodimer composed of two factor XIII (FXIII) A-subunits [FDA Label]. For people with congenital deficiency or mutation of Factor XIII, a rare bleeding disorder, exogenous replacement of this key coagulation factor is essential for management and prevention of bleeding episodes.     Also known as Fibrin Stabilizing Factor (FSF), Factor XIII is an endogenously available coagulation factor and the final enzyme within the blood coagulation cascade. Within the body, FXIII circulates as a heterotetramer composed of 2 catalytic A-subunits and 2 non-catalytic B-subunits (FXIII-A2B2) [A32363]. When activated by thrombin at the site of injury, the FXIII A2B2 pro-enzyme is cleaved resulting in activation of the catalytic A-subunit and dissociation from its carrier B-subunit. As a result, the active transglutaminase from subunit A cross-links fibrin and other proteins resulting in increased mechanical strength and resistance to fibrinolysis of the fibrin clot. This contributes to enhanced platelet and clot adhesion to injured tissue, thereby improving blood coagulation and maintenance of hemostasis [A18581].    When supplied as the recombinant form, Coagulation Factor XIII A-Subunit (Recombinant) binds to free human FXIII B-subunit resulting in a heterotetramer (rA2B2) with a similar activity profile and half-life as the endogenously available form. In patients with congenital factor XIII A-subunit deficiency, this product (marketed as Tretten) is indicated for the routine prophylaxis of bleeding. In these patients, activated rFXIII has been shown to increase the mechanical strength of fibrin clots, slow down fibrinolysis, and to enhance platelet adhesion to the site of injury. As the half-life of endogenous Factor XIII is long (5-11 days), prophylactic therapy with the replacement of FXIII can be given every 4-6 to maintain hemostasis[A32363].      Other drug products with similar structure and function to Coagulation Factor XIII A-Subunit (Recombinant) include [DB12909], which is a purified endogenous (human) form of coagulation factor XIII. Compared to Coagulation Factor XIII A-Subunit (Recombinant), which is produced through recombinant DNA technology where the target protein is grown in yeast and then isolated, the human form is isolated from pooled human plasma.    Coagulation Factor XIII A-Subunit (Recombinant) is available in the US as the commmercially available product Tretten, and in the EU as NovoThirteen. Tretten is manufactured as an intracellular, soluble protein in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) production strain containing the episomal expression vector, pD16. It is subsequently isolated by homogenization of cells and purification by several chromatography steps, including hydrophobic interaction and ion exchange chromatography [FDA Label].

UNII:6892UQT2GK	SUSOCTOCOG ALFA	UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T116; UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T121; Moroctocog alfa, also known as BDDrFVIII (B domain deleted recombinant factor VIII), is a recombinant DNA-based drug with functional characteristics comparable to those of endogenous coagulation Factor VIII, the essential human blood clotting protein that is impaired in Hemophilia A. Moroctocog alfa is identical in sequence to endogenously produced Factor VIII, but does not contain the B-domain, which has no known biological function. Moroctocog alfa is produced through recombinant DNA technology and purification, resulting in a 1438 amino acid, 170 kDa protein [FDA Label]. Clinical evaluation has shown that BDDrFVIII is pharmacokinetically equivalent to full-length recombinant FVIII [A32468, FDA Label].    Also known as Anti-Hemophilic Factor (AHF), endogenous Factor VIII is essential to the clotting process in the body due to its involvement in the clotting cascade where it is responsible for acting as a co-factor to Factor IX. Activation of Factor IX leads to a cascade of signals that results in activation of Factor X, which then results in the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, and as a result, leads to the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, the fibrous protein that creates the scaffold of the clot. Replacement of Factor VIII is essential for the treatment of Hemophilia A, which is caused by mutations in the Factor VIII gene, leading to a functional deficiency or complete loss of protein. Congenital loss or deficiency of Factor VIII results in the physiologic impairment of the coagulation clotting cascade, and as a result, leads to easy bruising and bleeding. Bleeding can range in severity from minor concerns, such as nosebleeds, to more serious events such as hemorrhaging in the joints, brain, or digestive tract [A32280].    Exogenous replacement of Factor VIII is currently the cornerstone of Hemophilia treatment and is used for the prophylaxis and control of bleeding episodes. Treatment has drastically improved since the 1960s when Factor VIII protein was primarily purified from human plasma, rather than being produced through recombinant DNA technology. Unfortunately, purification of protein from human plasma carries an increased risk of transmission of blood-borne diseases such as HIV and Hepatitis, which in part contributed to the Tainted Blood Scandal in the 1980s [A31551, A32272, L2177]. Use of recombinant DNA-derived clotting factor treatments, such as Moroctocog alfa, has reduced this risk.    Other drug products with similar structure and function to Moroctocog alfa include [DB13192], which is purified Factor VIII from human pooled blood and contains both A- and B-subunits, and [DB11607], which is a fully recombinant factor VIII-Fc fusion protein which has an extended half-life compared with conventional factor VIII due to conjugation to the dimeric Fc domain of human immunoglobulin G1, a long-lived plasma protein [A31551].    Moroctocog alfa is approved by Health Canada and by the European Medicines Agency for the control and prevention of hemorrhagic episodes and for routine and surgical prophylaxis in patients with hemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency or classic hemophilia). As it does not contain von Willebrand factor it is not indicated in von Willebrand’s disease [FDA Label].

CHEBI:136051	lusutrombopag	UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T109; UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T121; Lusutrombopag is an orally bioavailable thrombopoietin receptor (TPOR) agonist developed by Shionogi & Company (Osaka, Japan). TPOR is a regulatory target site for endogenous thrombopoietin, which acts as a primary cytokine to promote megakaryocyte proliferation and differentiation, and affect other hematopoietic lineages as well, including erythroid, granulocytic and lymphoid lineages [A36736]. Thrombocytopenia, which indicates abnormally low levels of platelets, is a common complication related to chronic liver disease. This hematological abnormality, especially in cases of severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count <50,000/μL), creates challenges to patients requiring invasive medical procedures where there is a significant risk for spontaneous bleeding [A36732]. Lusutrombopag binds to the transmembrane domain of TPOR expressed on megakaryocytes, and causes the proliferation and differentiation of megakaryocytic progenitor cells from hematopoietic stem cells [FDA Label].     In September 2015, lusutrombopag received its first global approval in Japan to reduce the need for platelet transfusion in adults with chronic liver disease and thrombocytopenia who are schedule to undergo an invasive medical procedure [A36730]. Lusutrombopag was approved by the FDA on July 31st, 2018 for the same therapeutic indication under the market name Mulpleta. In two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, patients with chronic liver disease and severe thrombocytopenia who were undergoing an invasive procedure with a platelet count less than 50 x 10^9/L were administered lusutrombopag orally [L4166]. Higher percentages (65-78%) of the patients receiving lusutrombopag required no platelet transfusion prior to the primary invasive procedure compared to those receiving placebo [L4166]. Lusutrombopag is currently in phase III development in various European countries including Austria, Belgium, Germany, and the UK [A36730].

More specifically, cobalamins are characterized by a porphyrin-like corrin nucleus that contains a single cobalt atom bound to a benzimidazolyl nucleotide and a variable residue (R) group. The variable R group gives rise to the four most commonly known cobalamins: cyanocobalamin, methylcobalamin, 5-deoxyadenosylcobalamin, and hydroxycobalamin. Hydroxocobalamin is found in all living organisms ranging from microbes to plants to animals. However, it is only synthesized in microbes and plants. As humans cannot make hydroxocobalamin, it is required in the diet, making it an essential nutrient (i.e. a vitamin).  Vitamin B12 is more abundant in animal products, especially meat, fish, eggs and dairy products although it is found in all fruits and vegetables in lower concentrations. In the serum, hydroxocobalamin and cyanocobalamin are believed to function as storage or transport forms of vitamin B12, whereas methylcobalamin and 5-deoxyadenosylcobalamin are the active forms of the coenzyme required for cell growth and replication. Hydroxocobalamin is often called vitamin B12 and is the natural form of vitamin B12, however, vitamin B12 refers to a group of cobalamins that are available in the human body in a variety of mostly interconvertible forms. Together with folate, cobalamins are essential cofactors required for DNA synthesis in cells where chromosomal replication and division are occurring. Cyanocobalamin is usually converted to hydroxocobalamin in the serum, whereas hydroxocobalamin is converted to either methylcobalamin or 5-deoxyadenosyl cobalamin. Cobalamins circulate bound to serum proteins called transcobalamins (TC) and haptocorrins. As a supplement hydroxocobalamin is used to treat vitamin B12 deficiency including pernicious anemia. It is also used in the prevention and treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency arising from alcoholism, malabsorption, tapeworm infestation, celiac disease, hyperthyroidism, hepatic-biliary tract disease, persistent diarrhea, ileal resection, pancreatic cancer, renal disease, prolonged stress, vegan diets, macrobiotic diets, and other restrictive diets. Other uses include treatment for cyanide poisoning, Leber's optic atrophy, and toxic amblyopia. Hydroxocobalamin is practically insoluble in water. Hydroxocobalamin was first isolated in 1949. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system. Hydroxocobalamin is available as a generic medication. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about 0.12 To 0.84 USD per dose. Commercially, it is made from one of a number of different types of bacteria.

It works by promoting the division and differentiation of committed erythroid progenitors in the bone marrow [FDA Label]. Epoetin alfa (Epoge) was developed by Amgen Inc. in 1983 as the first rhEPO commercialized in the United States, followed by other alfa and beta formulations. Epoetin alfa is a 165-amino acid erythropoiesis-stimulating glycoprotein produced in cell culture using recombinant DNA technology and is used for the treatment of patients with anemia associated with various clinical conditions, such as chronic renal failure, antiviral drug therapy, chemotherapy, or a high risk for perioperative blood loss from surgical procedures [FDA Label]. It has a molecular weight of approximately 30,400 daltons and is produced by mammalian cells into which the human erythropoietin gene has been introduced. The product contains the identical amino acid sequence of isolated natural erythropoietin and has the same biological activity as the endogenous erythropoietin. Epoetin alfa biosimilar, such as Retacrit (epoetin alfa-epbx or epoetin zeta), has been formulated to allow more access to treatment options for patients in the market [L2784]. The biosimilar is approved by the FDA and EMA as a safe, effective and affordable biological product and displays equivalent clinical efficacy, potency, and purity to the reference product [A7504]. Epoetin alfa formulations can be administered intravenously or subcutaneously.

It was developed by GSK for the treatment of anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).[A254167,A254162] In patients with CKD, the diseased kidney cannot induce erythropoietin (EPO) production in response to hypoxia or anemia. As a potent inhibitor of PHD1, PHD2 and PHD3 (≥ 1000-fold selectivity), daprodustat leads to the stabilization of cellular HIF1α and HIF2α and the induction of erythropoiesis.[A254157] A phase 3 clinical trial (NCT02879305) found that in patients with CKD undergoing dialysis, daprodustat was non-inferior to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents regarding the change in the hemoglobin level from baseline and cardiovascular outcomes.[A254172]    In June 2020, daprodustat was first approved in Japan for the treatment of renal anemia.[A254157] Daprodustat is currently under EMA and FDA review. On October 2022, the FDA Cardiovascular and Renal Drugs Advisory Committee (CRDAC) supported that the benefit of treatment with daprodustat outweighs the risks for adult dialysis patients with anemia of CKD but not for non-dialysis patients with anemia of CKD.[L43857]
UNII:I60W9520VV	VADADUSTAT	UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T116; UMLS Semantic Type: STY:T121; One of the most common symptoms of advanced renal disease is anemia, caused primarily by the inability of the kidney to respond to anemic conditions with a corresponding increase in [erythropoietin] (EPO) production.[A244165] Treatment of anemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD) has traditionally involved the administration of exogenous erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), such as [darbepoetin alfa], to counter the decrease in endogenous EPO production. While efficacious, the overuse of ESAs has been associated with cardiovascular complications, progression of CKD, and increases in overall mortality.[A244165]    A relatively new and alternative treatment option for patients with anemia of CKD are small molecule inhibitors of hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl-hydroxylase (HIF-PH). These agents inhibit prolyl-hydroxylase domain oxygen sensors, which essentially mimics hypoxic conditions and activates hypoxia-inducible factor, a transcription factor that serves a multitude of roles, including the stimulation erythropoiesis.[A244165]    Vadadustat is an orally administered inhibitor of hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl-hydroxylase (HIF-PH) which is currently approved in Japan[L39610] for the treatment for anemia due to CKD in both dialysis-dependent and non-dialysis dependent adult patients, and is currently awaiting a regulatory decision by the FDA for the same indication. The safety and efficacy of vadadustat have been shown to be non-inferior to darbepoetin alfa in patients with anemia of CKD undergoing dialysis,[A244145,A244155] but it did not meet the prespecified noninferiority criterion for cardiovascular safety in a similar study in patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD.[A244150]

CHEBI:16646	carbohydrate	"<h3>What are carbohydrates?</h3> Carbohydrates, or carbs, are sugar molecules. Along with <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/dietaryproteins.html"">proteins</a> and <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/dietaryfats.html"">fats</a>, carbohydrates are one of three main nutrients found in foods and drinks. Your body breaks down carbohydrates into glucose. Glucose, or <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/bloodsugar.html"">blood sugar</a>, is the main source of energy for your body's cells, tissues, and organs. Glucose can be used immediately or stored in the liver and muscles for later use. <h3>What are the different types of carbohydrates?</h3> There are three main types of carbohydrates: <strong>Sugars.</strong> They are also called simple carbohydrates because they are in the most basic form. They can be added to foods, such as the sugar in candy, desserts, processed foods, and regular soda. They also include the kinds of sugar that are found naturally in fruits, vegetables, and milk. <strong>Starches.</strong> They are complex carbohydrates, which are made of lots of simple sugars strung together. Your body needs to break starches down into sugars to use them for energy. Starches include bread, cereal, and pasta. They also include certain vegetables, like potatoes, peas, and corn. <strong><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/dietaryfiber.html"">Fiber</a>.</strong> It is also a complex carbohydrate. Your body cannot break down most fibers, so eating foods with fiber can help you feel full and make you less likely to overeat. Diets high in fiber have other health benefits. They may help prevent stomach or intestinal problems, such as <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/constipation.html"">constipation</a>. They may also help lower <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/cholesterol.html"">cholesterol</a> and blood sugar. Fiber is found in many foods that come from plants, including fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, beans, and whole grains.  <h3>Which foods have carbohydrates?</h3> Common foods with carbohydrates include: Grains, such as bread, noodles, pasta, crackers, cereals, and rice Fruits, such as apples, bananas, berries, mangoes, melons, and oranges Dairy products, such as milk and yogurt Legumes, including dried beans, lentils, and peas Snack foods and sweets, such as cakes, cookies, candy, and other desserts Juices, regular sodas, fruit drinks, sports drinks, and energy drinks that contain sugar Starchy vegetables, such as potatoes, corn, and peas  Some foods don't have a lot of carbohydrates, such as meat, fish, poultry, some types of cheese, nuts, and oils. <h3>Which types of carbohydrates should I eat?</h3> You do need to eat some carbohydrates to give your body energy. But it's important to eat the right kinds of carbohydrates for your health: When eating grains, choose mostly whole grains and not refined grains:  Whole grains are foods like whole wheat bread, brown rice, whole cornmeal, and oatmeal. They offer lots of nutrients that your body needs, like <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/vitamins.html"">vitamins</a>, <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/minerals.html"">minerals</a>, and fiber. To figure out whether a product has a lot of whole grain, check the ingredients list on the package and see if a whole grain is one of the first few items listed. Refined grains are foods that have had some parts of the grains removed. This also removes some of the nutrients that are good for your health.   Eat foods with lots of fiber. The <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/foodlabeling.html"">Nutrition Facts labels</a> on the back of food packages tells you how much fiber a product has. Try to avoid foods that have a lot of added sugar. These foods can have many calories but not much nutrition. Eating too much added sugar raises your blood sugar and can make you gain weight. You can tell if a food or drink has added sugars by looking at the Nutrition Facts label on the back of the food package. It tells you how much total sugar and added sugar is in that food or drink.  <h3>How many carbohydrates should I eat?</h3> There is no one-size-fits-all amount of carbohydrates that people should eat. This amount can vary, depending on factors such as your age, sex, health, and whether or not you are trying to lose or gain weight. On average, people should get 45 to 65% of their calories from carbohydrates every day. On the Nutrition Facts labels, the Daily Value for total carbohydrates is 275 g per day. This is based on a 2,000-calorie daily diet. Your Daily Value may be higher or lower depending on your calorie needs and health. <h3>Is it safe to eat a low-carb diet?</h3> Some people go on a low-carb diet to try to lose weight. This usually means eating between 25 g and 150 g of carbs each day. This kind of diet can be safe, but you should talk to your health care provider before starting it. One problem with low-carb diets is that they can limit the amount of fiber you get each day. They can also be hard to stay on for the long term.; A class of organic compounds composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen in a ratio of Cn(H2O)n.
